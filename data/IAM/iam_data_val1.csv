f04/f04-035/f04-035-02.png,"money to her relatives , and her brother-in-law was asked for"
f04/f04-035/f04-035-03.png,a detailed account of his movements on the 11th . The dead

f04/f04-039/f04-039-05.png,at Wandsworth . A passenger described this individual

f04/f04-043/f04-043-07.png,had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening .

f04/f04-049/f04-049-06.png,"his military bearing ) , and this was accepted ."

g01/g01-031/g01-031-01.png,was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its

g01/g01-031/g01-031-06.png,therefore in essence a forced payment whose
g01/g01-031/g01-031-07.png,return was the uncertain bounty of booty

g01/g01-067/g01-067-00.png,But this time there was a very interesting
g01/g01-067/g01-067-01.png,attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
g01/g01-067/g01-067-02.png,payments demanded . The definition of an

g01/g01-067/g01-067-07.png,and between these two extremes a graduated

g01/g01-067/g01-067-09.png,different classes of laymen and clerics .
g01/g01-070/g01-070-00.png,Again the resentment was widespread and
g01/g01-070/g01-070-01.png,the results disappointing - a tax estimated
g01/g01-070/g01-070-02.png,"to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 ."

g01/g01-070/g01-070-09.png,with hostelries and lodgings .
g01/g01-074/g01-074-00.png,London was again in turmoil ; but this time
g01/g01-074/g01-074-01.png,over a question of trade rivalry . A rich mer-

g01/g01-074/g01-074-04.png,those charged with the crime . It is clear
g01/g01-074/g01-074-05.png,from the chronicles that this was a sordid
g01/g01-074/g01-074-06.png,quarrel between monopolists and interlopers .
g01/g01-074/g01-074-07.png,The city merchants were jealous of foreign
g01/g01-074/g01-074-08.png,merchants who could tempt court and
g01/g01-074/g01-074-09.png,baronage with rarer luxuries than those
g01/g01-083/g01-083-00.png,"A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure"
g01/g01-083/g01-083-01.png,"to mediaeval eyes . It was determined that 100,000"
g01/g01-083/g01-083-02.png,"was a fairer target , and the Parliament agreed to find"

g01/g01-083/g01-083-05.png,Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax . The manifest
g01/g01-083/g01-083-06.png,injustice of this method had been to a certain degree
g01/g01-083/g01-083-07.png,"corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax ,"
g01/g01-083/g01-083-08.png,"but this lesson was ignored , and the injustice trebled in"

g01/g01-088/g01-088-04.png,The only concession made in view of the
g01/g01-088/g01-088-05.png,objections to the first two poll-taxes was
g01/g01-088/g01-088-06.png,the suggestion that the rich should help
g01/g01-088/g01-088-07.png,the poor - but this was only a pious hope
g01/g01-088/g01-088-08.png,because no machinery was provided for

g02/g02-059/g02-059-04.png,"the heart becomes generally constricted , its walls thicken ,"

g04/g04-048/g04-048-04.png,helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
