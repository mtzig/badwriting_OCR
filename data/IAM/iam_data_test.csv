m01/m01-049/m01-049-01.png,"and came into the livingroom , where"
m01/m01-049/m01-049-02.png,Heather and Steve stood aghast at
m01/m01-049/m01-049-03.png,"his entrance . He came , almost falling"
m01/m01-049/m01-049-04.png,"forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck"
m01/m01-049/m01-049-05.png,"thrust out , arms dangling loosely ."
m01/m01-049/m01-049-06.png,"Then , abruptly , he drew himself up"
m01/m01-049/m01-049-07.png,and walked on the very tips of
m01/m01-049/m01-049-08.png,his toes . He stretched his arms
m01/m01-049/m01-049-09.png,"over his head and yawned agape ,"
m01/m01-049/m01-049-10.png,drawing-in great breaths that
m01/m01-049/m01-049-11.png,became great sighs of ecstacy .
m01/m01-060/m01-060-00.png,""" They have come ! "" he said reverently , gripping his"
m01/m01-060/m01-060-01.png,hands together between his knees and leaning
m01/m01-060/m01-060-02.png,"forward . "" Isn't it a glorious thing ! Long awaited"
m01/m01-060/m01-060-03.png,"transcendent event , the exalted desire of all"

m01/m01-060/m01-060-06.png,upward and shook his head slowly from
m01/m01-079/m01-079-00.png,A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
m01/m01-079/m01-079-01.png,abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
m01/m01-079/m01-079-02.png,at an intersection for the light to change . At his
m01/m01-079/m01-079-03.png,apartment he garaged his car and then stood
m01/m01-079/m01-079-04.png,listening in the night . Listening in vain . For the
m01/m01-079/m01-079-05.png,"earth had lost its life-tempo , as the heart"
m01/m01-084/m01-084-00.png,"Deadly stillness , deadly portent !"
m01/m01-084/m01-084-01.png,Steve awakened early and switched on
m01/m01-084/m01-084-02.png,"the radio , which he kept tuned to CBO."
m01/m01-084/m01-084-03.png,The set lighted-up but gave only a low
m01/m01-084/m01-084-04.png,buzzing sound . He had just finished
m01/m01-084/m01-084-05.png,"shaving when it came on , with a flat"
m01/m01-084/m01-084-06.png,"voice repeating : "" This is BBC calling"
m01/m01-084/m01-084-07.png,"... this is BBC calling ... """
m01/m01-090/m01-090-00.png,"After what seemed an undue period of repetition , the voice"
m01/m01-090/m01-090-01.png,went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
m01/m01-090/m01-090-02.png,"in Sussex , in all its obscene details . Then the radio"
m01/m01-090/m01-090-03.png,"went dead again , and Steve had no stomach for"
m01/m01-090/m01-090-04.png,"breakfast . It was a beautiful day , as firsts-of-June"
m01/m01-090/m01-090-05.png,should be . Steve got out the car and traversed the
m01/m01-090/m01-090-06.png,"same empty streets as he had the night before ,"
m01/m01-090/m01-090-07.png,to keep an appointment with Heather .
m01/m01-095/m01-095-00.png,Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
m01/m01-095/m01-095-01.png,"Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A"
m01/m01-095/m01-095-02.png,flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
m01/m01-095/m01-095-03.png,the War Memorial . There was a deep
m01/m01-095/m01-095-04.png,"whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing"
m01/m01-095/m01-095-05.png,overtone that sang in his ears with an
m01/m01-095/m01-095-06.png,almost painful sharpness . He reversed and
m01/m01-095/m01-095-07.png,turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
m01/m01-104/m01-104-00.png,""" The Thetans , "" he said , "" are presumably here to"
m01/m01-104/m01-104-01.png,"take charge , as it were , of the minds of the"
m01/m01-104/m01-104-02.png,people - who are probably falling all over them-
m01/m01-104/m01-104-03.png,selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
m01/m01-104/m01-104-04.png,"them out . Just what these orders will be , we don't"
m01/m01-104/m01-104-05.png,"know . Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es-"
m01/m01-104/m01-104-06.png,caped Thetan subjugation . This time . But we no
m01/m01-104/m01-104-07.png,longer have any immunity .
m01/m01-110/m01-110-00.png,There can be little doubt that if the
m01/m01-110/m01-110-01.png,Thetans discover our mental independence
m01/m01-110/m01-110-02.png,they will promptly give us their hypnotic
m01/m01-110/m01-110-03.png,treatment . If we can avoid undue
m01/m01-110/m01-110-04.png,"prominence , it may be that we can"
m01/m01-110/m01-110-05.png,move about pretty freely without
m01/m01-110/m01-110-06.png,"detection . If we can - well , then we"
m01/m01-110/m01-110-07.png,may be able to promote our own
m01/m01-110/m01-110-08.png,interests . What those interests
m01/m01-110/m01-110-09.png,"are , beyond personal security ,"

m01/m01-115/m01-115-03.png,"find us out ! Second , to tread pretty warily"
m01/m01-115/m01-115-04.png,"among our own people , finding out just how"
m01/m01-115/m01-115-05.png,much freedom we can take with safety .
m01/m01-115/m01-115-06.png,"And third , to study these damned Thetans ."
m01/m01-115/m01-115-07.png,We must learn all we can about
m01/m01-121/m01-121-00.png,There is just a hope that we may uncover
m01/m01-121/m01-121-01.png,"some weakness , and find a way of fighting"
m01/m01-121/m01-121-02.png,"back at them . "" Heather agreed , and suggested"
m01/m01-121/m01-121-03.png,that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
m01/m01-121/m01-121-04.png,ting how the Thetan machinations had been
m01/m01-121/m01-121-05.png,working out . It occurred to Steve that this may
m01/m01-121/m01-121-06.png,not have been entirely an objective suggestion
m01/m01-121/m01-121-07.png,on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
m01/m01-125/m01-125-00.png,So they proceeded to see if the coast
m01/m01-125/m01-125-01.png,was clear . The street was quiet and
m01/m01-125/m01-125-02.png,"deserted , and there were neither sight"
m01/m01-125/m01-125-03.png,nor sound of flying saucers . So they
m01/m01-125/m01-125-04.png,ventured forth and made their way on
m01/m01-125/m01-125-05.png,foot to Dan's house . Dan came
m01/m01-125/m01-125-06.png,to the door at their ring but neglected
m01/m01-125/m01-125-07.png,to offer any greeting . He was deeply
m01/m01-125/m01-125-08.png,"preoccupied , and it seemed that the"
m01/m01-125/m01-125-09.png,ringing of a doorbell was to him
m01/m01-125/m01-125-10.png,a new and strange phenomenon .
m01/m01-131/m01-131-00.png,"When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action"
m01/m01-131/m01-131-01.png,gave the impression of having been thought out and
m01/m01-131/m01-131-02.png,"decided upon . Inside they sat down unbidden , while"
m01/m01-131/m01-131-03.png,Dan paced the floor . He seemed completely unaware
m01/m01-131/m01-131-04.png,"of their presence . They just stared at him , turning"
m01/m01-131/m01-131-05.png,their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
m01/m01-136/m01-136-00.png,His whole attitude was a mixture of
m01/m01-136/m01-136-01.png,impatience pending an awaited
m01/m01-136/m01-136-02.png,communication and of a vague
m01/m01-136/m01-136-03.png,perplexity respecting his surroundings
m01/m01-136/m01-136-04.png,and the purpose he was to serve .
m01/m01-136/m01-136-05.png,"Finally , being so obviously on their own ,"
m01/m01-136/m01-136-06.png,Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
m01/m01-136/m01-136-07.png,at home . Steve switched on Dan's
m01/m01-136/m01-136-08.png,"powerful , world-wide radio and systematically"
m01/m01-136/m01-136-09.png,turned the tuning knob through all the
m01/m01-136/m01-136-10.png,tuning points of the world's great radio
m01/m01-149/m01-149-00.png,"They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where"
m01/m01-149/m01-149-01.png,he waited . The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street .
m01/m01-149/m01-149-02.png,"But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon"
m01/m01-149/m01-149-03.png,the Avenue from its many tributary streets . It might have
m01/m01-149/m01-149-04.png,"been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies ."
m01/m01-149/m01-149-05.png,"First , it was Sunday morning ; and , second , everyone"
m01/m01-149/m01-149-06.png,"walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of"
m01/m01-149/m01-149-07.png,a single all-exclusive purpose .
m01/m01-160/m01-160-00.png,After a long wait a bus appeared and they
m01/m01-160/m01-160-01.png,"followed the beaming Dan aboard , taking"
m01/m01-160/m01-160-02.png,seats some rows behind him . Steve was
m01/m01-160/m01-160-03.png,"beginning to find the stereotyped , flattish , happy"
m01/m01-160/m01-160-04.png,faces very disconcerting ; and looking at
m01/m01-160/m01-160-05.png,Heather he found a welcome relief in her
m01/m01-160/m01-160-06.png,relatively long doleful one
m02/m02-048/m02-048-00.png,Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
m02/m02-048/m02-048-01.png,real days and would return to New York in late
m02/m02-048/m02-048-02.png,January or early February . Angelina might be a

m02/m02-048/m02-048-04.png,"as arranged , but he consoled himself by"
m02/m02-048/m02-048-05.png,thinking that he and Angelina would have
m02/m02-048/m02-048-06.png,plenty of time together in the future . And
m02/m02-048/m02-048-07.png,"Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be"
m02/m02-048/m02-048-08.png,"back on Moon again , and able to do"
m02/m02-048/m02-048-09.png,research at first hand into matters on which
m02/m02-048/m02-048-10.png,"the future of everyone , including Angelina , depended ..."
m02/m02-052/m02-052-00.png,The recovery of his balance was due to the
m02/m02-052/m02-052-01.png,"fact that he was living , virtually without"
m02/m02-052/m02-052-02.png,"expenses , with the people to whom Moke had"
m02/m02-052/m02-052-03.png,sent him : little people who regarded him as
m02/m02-052/m02-052-04.png,lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes .

m03/m03-095/m03-095-00.png,I had a distinct impression that the

m03/m03-095/m03-095-04.png,"until we were sent for , confirming"

m03/m03-110/m03-110-03.png,"to entertain for an instant the idea , the"

m03/m03-114/m03-114-04.png,we were all invaded by a most tranquil

n01/n01-000/n01-000-00.png,Alastair was a bachelor . All his life he had
n01/n01-000/n01-000-01.png,been inclined to regard women as something
n01/n01-000/n01-000-02.png,which must necessarily be subordinated to his
n01/n01-000/n01-000-03.png,career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
n01/n01-000/n01-000-04.png,"his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl"
n01/n01-000/n01-000-05.png,whom he had never met and on whom after no more
n01/n01-000/n01-000-06.png,than a couple of telephone calls he was
n01/n01-000/n01-000-07.png,prepared to place complete reliance .
n01/n01-004/n01-004-00.png,It was a novel experience . Alastair was
n01/n01-004/n01-004-01.png,quite unable to explain why he should feel
n01/n01-004/n01-004-02.png,so much confidence in her . Once again
n01/n01-004/n01-004-03.png,she checked back her instructions . It was
n01/n01-004/n01-004-04.png,obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
n01/n01-004/n01-004-05.png,faith which he was placing in her and
n01/n01-004/n01-004-06.png,was prepared to accept the responsibility .
n01/n01-009/n01-009-00.png,""" Good luck , Air Marshal , "" she said gently . "" I 'll"
n01/n01-009/n01-009-01.png,be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this
n01/n01-009/n01-009-02.png,evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
n01/n01-009/n01-009-03.png,"both at midnight . "" They might have been"
n01/n01-009/n01-009-04.png,arranging a supper party . Then she rang off .
n01/n01-009/n01-009-05.png,Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
n01/n01-009/n01-009-06.png,uneventful life had he come across a girl who
n01/n01-009/n01-009-07.png,sounded so charming and appeared to be so
n01/n01-020/n01-020-00.png,For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
n01/n01-020/n01-020-01.png,to switch on the lights ; there was no colour -
n01/n01-020/n01-020-02.png,physical features were distinguishable solely by
n01/n01-020/n01-020-03.png,gradations of silvery greyness . Even the snow-
n01/n01-020/n01-020-04.png,"capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles"
n01/n01-020/n01-020-05.png,"below , was not recognisable among the host"
n01/n01-020/n01-020-06.png,of lower peaks . The screen of the air-to-air
n01/n01-020/n01-020-07.png,radar glowed . Occasionally minute spots
n01/n01-020/n01-020-08.png,"flickered across its surface , but there was"
n01/n01-031/n01-031-00.png,In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
n01/n01-031/n01-031-01.png,make a direct comparison between the radar
n01/n01-031/n01-031-02.png,image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the
n01/n01-031/n01-031-03.png,"Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the"
n01/n01-031/n01-031-04.png,"left , Milan . The directional angle of the"
n01/n01-031/n01-031-05.png,scanner could be adjusted to cover any
n01/n01-031/n01-031-06.png,particular area within its range . Geoffrey
n01/n01-031/n01-031-07.png,turned the scale slowly to cover the
n01/n01-031/n01-031-08.png,ground immediately ahead .
n01/n01-036/n01-036-00.png,"He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the"
n01/n01-036/n01-036-01.png,"naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even"
n01/n01-036/n01-036-02.png,on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced
n01/n01-036/n01-036-03.png,at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that
n01/n01-036/n01-036-04.png,the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
n01/n01-036/n01-036-05.png,was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
n01/n01-045/n01-045-00.png,"Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the"
n01/n01-045/n01-045-01.png,pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
n01/n01-045/n01-045-02.png,dipped slightly . The needle of the speed
n01/n01-045/n01-045-03.png,"recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0"
n01/n01-045/n01-045-04.png,"before coming to rest at 5.0 . "" We 're a bit"
n01/n01-045/n01-045-05.png,"ahead of time , "" said Alastair . "" We 'll run"
n01/n01-045/n01-045-06.png,"in on minimum engine power . "" Geoffrey"
n01/n01-045/n01-045-07.png,smiled . Alastair talked of running in when
n01/n01-045/n01-045-08.png,they were still more than four hundred
n01/n01-045/n01-045-09.png,miles from their destination .
n01/n01-052/n01-052-00.png,They were nearing Modena . Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
n01/n01-052/n01-052-01.png,"on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port ."
n01/n01-052/n01-052-02.png,He was able to trace the course of the river ; he
n01/n01-052/n01-052-03.png,"thought he could recognise the route of N12 ,"
n01/n01-052/n01-052-04.png,along which he had motored so desperately little
n01/n01-052/n01-052-05.png,more than twenty-four hours earlier . Since then
n01/n01-052/n01-052-06.png,"he had flown to England , attended the vital"
n01/n01-052/n01-052-07.png,"conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked"
n01/n01-052/n01-052-08.png,by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
n01/n01-052/n01-052-09.png,"Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed"
n01/n01-052/n01-052-10.png,refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
n01/n01-052/n01-052-11.png,of the journey back to the place where every
n01/n01-052/n01-052-12.png,indication pointed to Eve being held .
n01/n01-057/n01-057-00.png,Geoffrey set himself to consider the
n01/n01-057/n01-057-01.png,movements of the Bentley . It had passed
n01/n01-057/n01-057-02.png,him at the temporary bridge over the
n01/n01-057/n01-057-03.png,Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
n01/n01-057/n01-057-04.png,previous night . He worked out the distance
n01/n01-057/n01-057-05.png,on the presumption that its route had been
n01/n01-057/n01-057-06.png,through Florence and Rome and then
n01/n01-057/n01-057-07.png,across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
n01/n01-057/n01-057-08.png,It came to just over six hundred
n02/n02-000/n02-000-00.png,DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the
n02/n02-000/n02-000-01.png,"time they docked at Belleray . And though Guy ,"
n02/n02-000/n02-000-02.png,"made nervous by Beryl's silence , drove at reckless"
n02/n02-000/n02-000-03.png,"speed to the Villa , it was quickly evident that"
n02/n02-000/n02-000-04.png,the party was over . Piers came strolling out to
n02/n02-000/n02-000-05.png,"meet the Deanes , and as soon as Guy had"
n02/n02-000/n02-000-06.png,"driven away , invited them casually to come to"
n02/n02-004/n02-004-00.png,"To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a"
n02/n02-004/n02-004-01.png,vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent
n02/n02-004/n02-004-02.png,reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
n02/n02-004/n02-004-03.png,But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
n02/n02-004/n02-004-04.png,was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
n02/n02-004/n02-004-05.png,"He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his"
n02/n02-004/n02-004-06.png,"own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of"
n02/n02-004/n02-004-07.png,asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
n02/n02-004/n02-004-08.png,to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
n02/n02-009/n02-009-00.png,""" I caught him just as he was going to the"

n02/n02-009/n02-009-04.png,"too . They 're both here . "" "" I didn't know she was"
n02/n02-009/n02-009-05.png,"coming back from Barbados so soon . "" Beryl"
n02/n02-009/n02-009-06.png,said the first thing that came into her head .

n02/n02-016/n02-016-01.png,"casual tone , "" She 's not returning to her family . She 's"
n02/n02-016/n02-016-02.png,"going to live with friends of the bank manager , just"

n02/n02-016/n02-016-05.png,to sort things out in her mind . That beneath his
n02/n02-016/n02-016-06.png,unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering
n02/n02-016/n02-016-07.png,with anger against her she had no doubt .
n02/n02-028/n02-028-00.png,"Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to"

n02/n02-028/n02-028-03.png,"suggested having a second party , the following week , he"
n02/n02-028/n02-028-04.png,"poured cold water on the project . Everyone , he declared ,"
n02/n02-028/n02-028-05.png,"had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them"
n02/n02-028/n02-028-06.png,nearly to next week to settle down again . Meanwhile
n02/n02-028/n02-028-07.png,Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
n02/n02-028/n02-028-08.png,earned gratuity to his native village at the

n02/n02-033/n02-033-01.png,For the time being Beryl was content to let
n02/n02-033/n02-033-02.png,"it go at that , but she resolved to have"
n02/n02-033/n02-033-03.png,it out with Piers when a reasonable
n02/n02-033/n02-033-04.png,opportunity presented itself . He must
n02/n02-033/n02-033-05.png,learn that he could not treat her
n02/n02-033/n02-033-06.png,"with injustice and contempt , ignoring"
n02/n02-033/n02-033-07.png,her explanations as though he were
