a03/a03-009/a03-009-00.png,The wish was particularly apparent in comments

a03/a03-009/a03-009-06.png,Tito would like some such idea extended also

a03/a03-030/a03-030-05.png,foundations on which to win the next
a03/a03-030/a03-030-06.png,election . The rally comes at a time
a03/a03-030/a03-030-07.png,when in spite of carefully worded state-
a03/a03-030/a03-030-08.png,ments by the Prime Minister there is an
a03/a03-030/a03-030-09.png,air of electoral expectancy .
a03/a03-034/a03-034-00.png,Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
a03/a03-034/a03-034-01.png,a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks
a03/a03-034/a03-034-02.png,which outlines in some detail the accomplishments

a03/a03-034/a03-034-04.png,a half years ago . Nevertheless there is little
a03/a03-034/a03-034-05.png,illusion in the Conservative Party that their
a03/a03-034/a03-034-06.png,stock at home has fallen in the face of
a03/a03-034/a03-034-07.png,heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy .
a03/a03-037/a03-037-00.png,Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative
a03/a03-037/a03-037-01.png,"provincial governments , Quebec and New Brunswick , and"

a03/a03-037/a03-037-03.png,fared badly . They are now faced with four other by-

a03/a03-040/a03-040-00.png,All four were Conservative strongholds . Last September
a03/a03-040/a03-040-01.png,a public poll showed that for the first time since
a03/a03-040/a03-040-02.png,the Administration came to power in 1957 the
a03/a03-040/a03-040-03.png,Liberals were ahead ( 43 per cent were in favour

a03/a03-043/a03-043-00.png,"However , a separate poll revealed that Mr."
a03/a03-043/a03-043-01.png,Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of
a03/a03-043/a03-043-02.png,popularity as an individual leader ( for

a03/a03-043/a03-043-04.png,Pearson 34 per cent ) . How far is Mr.
a03/a03-043/a03-043-05.png,Lester Pearson acceptable to the people
a03/a03-043/a03-043-06.png,of Canada as a Prime Minister ? Many
a03/a03-043/a03-043-07.png,observers at the national rally will be
a03/a03-047/a03-047-00.png,It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
a03/a03-047/a03-047-01.png,in the role of a popular orator at the

a03/a03-047/a03-047-03.png,baker was in the last two campaigns . The
a03/a03-047/a03-047-04.png,impression remains that the Liberal leader
a03/a03-047/a03-047-05.png,"is still the diplomatist , more at home"
a03/a03-047/a03-047-06.png,"in the chancery , or the corridors of the United"

a03/a03-066/a03-066-00.png,Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to
a03/a03-066/a03-066-01.png,"remove these doubts , and to persuade the"

a05/a05-004/a05-004-02.png,"Air Force would become , for practical purposes ,"
a05/a05-004/a05-004-03.png,a single defence force . There would be
a05/a05-004/a05-004-04.png,complete co-operation at all levels in training
a05/a05-004/a05-004-05.png,and operations . This would apply also in the
a05/a05-004/a05-004-06.png,command structure and central administrative
a05/a05-004/a05-004-07.png,"organisation . Mr. Watkinson , Minister of Defence ,"
a05/a05-004/a05-004-08.png,"has been working on the plan for some months ,"
a05/a05-004/a05-004-09.png,with the Prime Minister's approval .
a05/a05-009/a05-009-00.png,He has had numerous meetings with the Service
a05/a05-009/a05-009-01.png,Ministers . He has also had talks with the Earl
a05/a05-009/a05-009-02.png,"of Home , Foreign Secretary , and with other"
a05/a05-009/a05-009-03.png,Ministers concerned with overseas aspects
a05/a05-009/a05-009-04.png,of defence policy . Details of the scheme
a05/a05-009/a05-009-05.png,are now being worked out by the Chiefs
a05/a05-009/a05-009-06.png,"of Staff , a process that may take four"
a05/a05-013/a05-013-00.png,The scheme will be subject to Cabinet
a05/a05-013/a05-013-01.png,approval . Mr. Watkinson remains con-
a05/a05-013/a05-013-02.png,vinced that the policy initiated in
a05/a05-013/a05-013-03.png,"1957 , in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister"
a05/a05-013/a05-013-04.png,"of Defence , is still correct . This was to"
a05/a05-013/a05-013-05.png,return to the tradition of all-Regular
a05/a05-013/a05-013-06.png,"voluntary forces , with the last National"

a05/a05-017/a05-017-00.png,The Minister regards the recent trend
a05/a05-017/a05-017-01.png,of recruiting figures as encouraging .
a05/a05-017/a05-017-02.png,He is confident the aim can be achieved .
a05/a05-017/a05-017-03.png,While the possibility of an eventual return
a05/a05-017/a05-017-04.png,to National Service in some form
a05/a05-017/a05-017-05.png,"cannot be entirely discounted , he does"
a05/a05-017/a05-017-06.png,not agree that the point has been reached
a05/a05-017/a05-017-07.png,where this need even be considered . If
a05/a05-017/a05-017-08.png,"National Service is ever resorted to ,"
a05/a05-017/a05-017-09.png,engagement would probably have to be for
a05/a05-022/a05-022-00.png,It is thought this would be the minimum
a05/a05-022/a05-022-01.png,necessary for the extended training modern
a05/a05-022/a05-022-02.png,arms require and to enable each man to
a05/a05-022/a05-022-03.png,serve at least a year overseas . There is
a05/a05-022/a05-022-04.png,no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
a05/a05-022/a05-022-05.png,is at odds with the Service chiefs over
a05/a05-022/a05-022-06.png,the decision to dispense with National
a05/a05-022/a05-022-07.png,"Service , or over any other aspect of"
a05/a05-025/a05-025-00.png,Criticisms about Army manpower appear
a05/a05-025/a05-025-01.png,to have come mainly from retired officers
a05/a05-025/a05-025-02.png,who have held high positions but
a05/a05-025/a05-025-03.png,are out of touch with the existing situation .
a05/a05-025/a05-025-04.png,Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
a05/a05-025/a05-025-05.png,"from the C.I.G.S. , Field-Marshal Sir"
a05/a05-025/a05-025-06.png,"Francis Festing , who believes completely"
a05/a05-025/a05-025-07.png,in the principle of an all-Regular army .

a05/a05-025/a05-025-09.png,"Sir Francis , is equally convinced Mr."

a05/a05-029/a05-029-02.png,"September , was delayed because of the"
a05/a05-029/a05-029-03.png,Berlin crisis . Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
a05/a05-029/a05-029-04.png,felt the change would be unwise at a
a05/a05-029/a05-029-05.png,moment # when attention had to be
a05/a05-029/a05-029-06.png,concentrated on possible need for important

a05/a05-039/a05-039-02.png,the Prime Minister . This implies the dis-
a05/a05-039/a05-039-03.png,appearance of the Progressive party from
a05/a05-039/a05-039-04.png,the House . Early results in yesterday's
a05/a05-039/a05-039-05.png,general election showed Nationalists being

a05/a05-048/a05-048-01.png,evident that voters were bored by the
a05/a05-048/a05-048-02.png,Government's frequent appeals to the electorate .
a05/a05-048/a05-048-03.png,The election was the fourth in four years .
a05/a05-048/a05-048-04.png,In most constituencies it may go down as
a05/a05-048/a05-048-05.png,the most apathetic in the country's history .
a05/a05-048/a05-048-06.png,THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons
a05/a05-048/a05-048-07.png,last night that he had considered early
a05/a05-048/a05-048-08.png,in the Parliamentary recess whether to
a05/a05-048/a05-048-09.png,mobilise reserves necessary to bring the
a05/a05-048/a05-048-10.png,British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing .
a05/a05-053/a05-053-00.png,He decided that it would be a great error
a05/a05-053/a05-053-01.png,to do so and to recall Parliament . But
a05/a05-053/a05-053-02.png,there would be no hesitation in mobilising
a05/a05-053/a05-053-03.png,if a further deterioration in the situation
a05/a05-053/a05-053-04.png,warranted such a step . It would have to be
a05/a05-053/a05-053-05.png,"accompanied by other measures of a military ,"
a05/a05-053/a05-053-06.png,"economic and political kind . Mr. Macmillan ,"
a05/a05-053/a05-053-07.png,who was winding up the foreign affairs
a05/a05-053/a05-053-08.png,"debate , said the Government could not"
a05/a05-053/a05-053-09.png,be party to accepting as a matter of
a05/a05-053/a05-053-10.png,principle the imposed division of Germany .

a05/a05-058/a05-058-01.png,but we must not - and I am not - be

a05/a05-058/a05-058-03.png,"Minister of State , Foreign Office , said"
a05/a05-058/a05-058-04.png,earlier that the Government had asked
a05/a05-058/a05-058-05.png,the Medical Research Council to reassess
a05/a05-058/a05-058-06.png,the fall-out position in view of the Russian
a05/a05-058/a05-058-07.png,tests . The Council's findings would be
a05/a05-062/a05-062-00.png,With a vigour and authority which delighted

a05/a05-062/a05-062-04.png,"of Lords last night , gave a warning"
a05/a05-062/a05-062-05.png,that # appeasement over Berlin could
a05/a05-062/a05-062-06.png,"only lead to war . To stand firm , he"
a05/a05-062/a05-062-07.png,"declared , was not to invite war , but"
a05/a05-062/a05-062-08.png,the surest way to avert it .
a05/a05-069/a05-069-00.png,It was the end of a rather curious
a05/a05-069/a05-069-01.png,speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
a05/a05-069/a05-069-02.png,the two-day debate on foreign affairs .
a05/a05-069/a05-069-03.png,"He began in a low , almost chatty mono-"
a05/a05-069/a05-069-04.png,"tone , and his voice never rose to any"
a05/a05-069/a05-069-05.png,accent of urgency . He passed in rapid
a05/a05-069/a05-069-06.png,review the United Nations Secretariat ;
a05/a05-069/a05-069-07.png,nuclear tests ; the canard about British
a05/a05-069/a05-069-08.png,interference with the United Nations
a05/a05-069/a05-069-09.png,in the Congo ; Kuwait ; and South-East
a05/a05-073/a05-073-00.png,He spent most of his short half-hour on
a05/a05-073/a05-073-01.png,Berlin . He deplored the possibility of
a05/a05-073/a05-073-02.png,"some "" new myth "" about betrayal of Germany"
a05/a05-073/a05-073-03.png,"by the Allies . "" We do not , "" he said , "" really"
a05/a05-073/a05-073-04.png,"know what the Russians want . "" But he was"
a05/a05-073/a05-073-05.png,certain that they wanted to establish a
a05/a05-073/a05-073-06.png,final and irrevocable division of Germany .
a05/a05-073/a05-073-07.png,Britain could not be a party to an imposed
a05/a05-073/a05-073-08.png,"division . But negotiation , as the debate had"
a05/a05-073/a05-073-09.png,"shown , could be undertaken on a variety"
a05/a05-080/a05-080-00.png,Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
a05/a05-080/a05-080-01.png,ately refrained during the summer from
a05/a05-080/a05-080-02.png,recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
a05/a05-080/a05-080-03.png,"by proclamation , such as would be"
a05/a05-080/a05-080-04.png,necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
a05/a05-080/a05-080-05.png,on to a fully active footing . That
a05/a05-080/a05-080-06.png,would have created a thoroughly unde-
a05/a05-080/a05-080-07.png,sirable atmosphere of panic . He thought
a05/a05-080/a05-080-08.png,that the situation was rather more
a05/a05-084/a05-084-00.png,The Russians now realised its seriousness . The
a05/a05-084/a05-084-01.png,French doubts were more about procedure
a05/a05-084/a05-084-02.png,than about substance . The Prime Minister's
a05/a05-084/a05-084-03.png,attitude of studied calm brought down the
a05/a05-084/a05-084-04.png,"temperature of the debate , which never"
a05/a05-084/a05-084-05.png,"at any time rose to fever pitch , to a"
a05/a05-084/a05-084-06.png,remarkable degree of sub-normality .

a05/a05-084/a05-084-08.png,"of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening"
a05/a05-084/a05-084-09.png,in the Peers' Gallery .
a05/a05-089/a05-089-00.png,The early speakers in the debate each
a05/a05-089/a05-089-01.png,severely rated the speech of his predecessor .
a05/a05-089/a05-089-02.png,These strictures were all too well justified .
a05/a05-089/a05-089-03.png,We started with the plaintive wailings
a05/a05-089/a05-089-04.png,"of Mr. Healey , "" Shadow "" Foreign Secretary ,"
a05/a05-089/a05-089-05.png,"described by Mr. Godber , Minister of"

a05/a05-089/a05-089-07.png,"obscure on Berlin , damaging and obscure"

a05/a05-089/a05-089-10.png,"Defence Minister , for having read the"
a05/a05-094/a05-094-00.png,The trouble about such debates is that
a05/a05-094/a05-094-01.png,they range too widely . They remind one of
a05/a05-094/a05-094-02.png,"the Rugby match in "" Tom Brown's Schooldays , """
a05/a05-094/a05-094-03.png,in which all the boys were welcome to

a05/a05-094/a05-094-06.png,metaphorical braces were visible in the
a05/a05-094/a05-094-07.png,early stages of to-night's debate . Mr.
a05/a05-094/a05-094-08.png,Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's
a05/a05-094/a05-094-09.png,"golf-course Press conference , which he"
a05/a05-094/a05-094-10.png,"described as "" a display of flabby and"

a05/a05-099/a05-099-02.png,"from Mr. Ellis Smith ( Lab. , Stoke on Trent S. ) ."
a05/a05-099/a05-099-03.png,Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
a05/a05-099/a05-099-04.png,theme of limitation of armaments in Europe .
a05/a05-099/a05-099-05.png,"This could , he suggested , be linked with"
a05/a05-099/a05-099-06.png,prohibition of the production of atomic

a05/a05-099/a05-099-08.png,and control would be much easier to
a05/a05-099/a05-099-09.png,establish in these territories .
a05/a05-104/a05-104-00.png,Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
a05/a05-104/a05-104-01.png,using double standards . Ministers had
a05/a05-104/a05-104-02.png,rebuked the unaligned nations for not
a05/a05-104/a05-104-03.png,"condemning the new Russian tests , but"
a05/a05-104/a05-104-04.png,they themselves had no condemnation for
a05/a05-104/a05-104-05.png,events in Angola or Algeria . It was not for

a05/a05-108/a05-108-01.png,religion as had failed to detect this cult .
a05/a05-108/a05-108-02.png,But Mr. Healey had a partial and
a05/a05-108/a05-108-03.png,limited success . He rallied behind him
a05/a05-108/a05-108-04.png,the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last
a05/a05-108/a05-108-05.png,"night by his leader , Mr. Gaitskell . Mr."
a05/a05-108/a05-108-06.png,Godber's performance merited all the mild
a05/a05-108/a05-108-07.png,scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell .
a05/a05-113/a05-113-00.png,"True , he did tell the House that the"

a05/a05-113/a05-113-05.png,He was not so happy in his defence of

a05/a05-113/a05-113-07.png,France for her nuclear tests in the

b01/b01-038/b01-038-07.png,What it means in practical terms is that our

b01/b01-062/b01-062-01.png,This is a difficult question . It would obviously

b01/b01-073/b01-073-05.png,understood . The Sudan's concern for its

b01/b01-132/b01-132-00.png,The shock of expulsion from the
b01/b01-132/b01-132-01.png,Commonwealth now seems to be the only
b01/b01-132/b01-132-02.png,way left to try to bring home to the people of
b01/b01-132/b01-132-03.png,South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them
b01/b01-132/b01-132-04.png,to disaster . It may be that the Commonwealth
b01/b01-132/b01-132-05.png,Prime Ministers will decide against this final
b01/b01-132/b01-132-06.png,step . If that is their decision they should also
b01/b01-132/b01-132-07.png,go unequivocally on record that they regard
b01/b01-132/b01-132-08.png,apartheid as evil and indefensible .
b01/b01-136/b01-136-00.png,"Unless they do at least that , Dr. Verwoerd will"

b01/b01-136/b01-136-07.png,about the nuptial arrangements .
b02/b02-013/b02-013-00.png,What seems certain is that those who

b02/b02-013/b02-013-02.png,Mr Krushchev gives evidence of a change
b02/b02-013/b02-013-03.png,of heart ( whatever that may mean ) would
b02/b02-013/b02-013-04.png,have us run risks greater than the West

b02/b02-013/b02-013-06.png,Kennedy's most influential advisers seem
b02/b02-013/b02-013-07.png,disposed to face . The real question is
b02/b02-013/b02-013-08.png,what we should put to the Soviet
b02/b02-013/b02-013-09.png,Government as a basis for talks : and

b02/b02-035/b02-035-01.png,"manoeuvring , and what we should call"
b02/b02-035/b02-035-02.png,"cool-headed and inventive negotiation , is"
b02/b02-035/b02-035-03.png,a means not to destruction but to safety .
b02/b02-035/b02-035-04.png,The Government's pompous little statement
b02/b02-035/b02-035-05.png,"on Northern Rhodesia does not say much ,"
b02/b02-035/b02-035-06.png,but it says what is necessary - that
b02/b02-035/b02-035-07.png,the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is
b02/b02-035/b02-035-08.png,"open to revision . This is news , however"
b02/b02-035/b02-035-09.png,much the Government tries to disguise
b02/b02-035/b02-035-10.png,it by saying that the revision would be

b02/b02-045/b02-045-02.png,very unlikely ; if Formula Three restores the original
b02/b02-045/b02-045-03.png,"principle , that is all that need be required of it . It is a pity"
b02/b02-045/b02-045-04.png,that the Government should ever have been led away
b02/b02-045/b02-045-05.png,from this principle . It is a great pity that the
b02/b02-045/b02-045-06.png,"Government should give the appearance of responding , not"
b02/b02-045/b02-045-07.png,"to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations , but to"

b02/b02-097/b02-097-06.png,been an election campaign which more people
b02/b02-097/b02-097-07.png,in and out of the country wanted to see over
b02/b02-102/b02-102-00.png,To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a
b02/b02-102/b02-102-01.png,millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their

b02/b02-102/b02-102-03.png,the Berlin crisis . It need not have been such a burden
b02/b02-102/b02-102-04.png,if Western Governments had not been convinced
b02/b02-102/b02-102-05.png,that they must do nothing to harm even remotely Dr

b02/b02-105/b02-105-00.png,But they were so convinced and they
b02/b02-105/b02-105-01.png,have had to take the consequences . Mean-

b03/b03-025/b03-025-02.png,truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament
b03/b03-025/b03-025-03.png,cannot be followed together . What the council has done -
b03/b03-025/b03-025-04.png,and it is an achievement - is to make religious con-

b03/b03-087/b03-087-01.png,agreement is signed . To this there will be some opposition . The Bill is
b03/b03-087/b03-087-02.png,"short and modest in scope , and it is doubtful whether the other Private"
b03/b03-087/b03-087-03.png,Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps . This fact may give
b03/b03-087/b03-087-04.png,the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the

b03/b03-104/b03-104-08.png,any reason why the centigrade countries
b03/b03-104/b03-104-09.png,should not change to fahrenheit ?
b03/b03-109/b03-109-00.png,Can it be shown that the one scale is demon-

b03/b03-109/b03-109-02.png,be in for a stiffer fight than they think . They may
b03/b03-109/b03-109-03.png,have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market .
b03/b03-109/b03-109-04.png,Even then it might be easier to persuade the British
b03/b03-109/b03-109-05.png,public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain
b03/b03-109/b03-109-06.png,circumstances the time would come when this would
b03/b03-109/b03-109-07.png,suit their convenience - rather than to change their

b04/b04-096/b04-096-02.png,present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many
b04/b04-096/b04-096-03.png,worthwhile targets for the Opposition . What a pity

b04/b04-107/b04-107-01.png,in Rhodesia ! Eighteen months ago this territory
b04/b04-107/b04-107-02.png,"was peaceful , orderly , and thriving . Africans within the"
b04/b04-107/b04-107-03.png,Federal Government were getting valuable experience in
b04/b04-107/b04-107-04.png,administration . Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial
b04/b04-107/b04-107-05.png,Secretary . Suddenly everything changed . Timetables were
b04/b04-107/b04-107-06.png,scrapped . The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was
b04/b04-107/b04-107-07.png,"rushed out to Rhodesia . Overnight , minor African"
b04/b04-107/b04-107-08.png,politicians were inflated into international figures .
b04/b04-116/b04-116-00.png,And as the British Government stepped up the pace
b04/b04-116/b04-116-01.png,"of change , so the Africans stepped up their demands ."
b04/b04-116/b04-116-02.png,"TODAY , in London , that rash and thoughtless policy has"
b04/b04-116/b04-116-03.png,caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened .
b04/b04-116/b04-116-04.png,No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching .
b04/b04-116/b04-116-05.png,If the Government now reverses its plan to give the
b04/b04-116/b04-116-06.png,Africans control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face
b04/b04-116/b04-116-07.png,difficulties from African politicians greedy for power .
b04/b04-121/b04-121-00.png,But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well
b04/b04-121/b04-121-01.png,"be plunged into chaos , like the Congo . For Mr."
b04/b04-121/b04-121-02.png,Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice . They
b04/b04-121/b04-121-03.png,must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos . And try to
b04/b04-121/b04-121-04.png,repair the damage they have done . WHO can grow the
b04/b04-121/b04-121-05.png,fastest ? That is the exciting competition going on
b04/b04-121/b04-121-06.png,among Britain's major industries .
b04/b04-128/b04-128-00.png,"Top of the table , at the moment , is the chemical industry ."
b04/b04-128/b04-128-01.png,"Then comes engineering , followed by iron and steel ."
b04/b04-128/b04-128-02.png,Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
b04/b04-128/b04-128-03.png,tremendous upsurge in investment . It reports that new
b04/b04-128/b04-128-04.png,factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
b04/b04-128/b04-128-05.png,up on 1960 . Britain's business men are right to back
b04/b04-134/b04-134-00.png,For expansion today means still greater

b04/b04-134/b04-134-07.png,philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
b04/b04-134/b04-134-08.png,who has been spectacularly wrong on the great

b04/b04-140/b04-140-02.png,After the war he favoured a preventive war against

b06/b06-090/b06-090-05.png,that the movement will go on record against
b06/b06-090/b06-090-06.png,the Polaris base and facilities for German bases

c04/c04-044/c04-044-02.png,"had style , moved at a quick pace and everyone did"
c04/c04-044/c04-044-03.png,well . But it was Mr. Houston's evening .

c04/c04-056/c04-056-02.png,The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old
c04/c04-056/c04-056-03.png,lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
c04/c04-056/c04-056-04.png,of his trousers . The action moved at tremendous
c04/c04-056/c04-056-05.png,"speed , backed by some wonderful timing by"
c04/c04-056/c04-056-06.png,the cast . I especially liked the tea-cup
c04/c04-056/c04-056-07.png,scene where six of the cast changed

c04/c04-061/c04-061-01.png,as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable . They
c04/c04-061/c04-061-02.png,alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut
c04/c04-061/c04-061-03.png,through the gormless standing corn around them . Perhaps
c04/c04-061/c04-061-04.png,it was accidental - I hope not . If ever a bag of
c04/c04-061/c04-061-05.png,humour needed a thorough shaking up the Whitehall

e01/e01-050/e01-050-02.png,convents of Europe . Without doubt it was the
e01/e01-050/e01-050-03.png,nuns who carried the craft to Ireland . There it
e01/e01-050/e01-050-04.png,was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive

e01/e01-062/e01-062-04.png,it is reasonably quick to work . In the following
e01/e01-062/e01-062-05.png,pages simple diagrams and instructions are given
e01/e01-062/e01-062-06.png,to enable the beginner to master all the essential
e01/e01-081/e01-081-00.png,First launder crochet and then pin to the required

e01/e01-081/e01-081-02.png,accurate . Place crochet in correct position on linen and
e01/e01-081/e01-081-03.png,secure with pins . Run a line of basting stitches
e01/e01-081/e01-081-04.png,on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges
e01/e01-081/e01-081-05.png,which are to be attached to the linen . Remove crochet .
e01/e01-086/e01-086-00.png,Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen :

e01/e01-102/e01-102-01.png,the beauty of crochet . The finer mercerised threads
e01/e01-102/e01-102-02.png,are more effective for the delicate designs used for
e01/e01-102/e01-102-03.png,"tablecloths , doilies , edgings and accessories , while"

e02/e02-014/e02-014-03.png,as before . It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
e02/e02-014/e02-014-04.png,the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth
e02/e02-014/e02-014-05.png,of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces

e02/e02-018/e02-018-04.png,"pencil line at the top , the work will be"
e02/e02-018/e02-018-05.png,accurate . The straight-edge can be used
e02/e02-018/e02-018-06.png,to test the straightness of the sides .
e02/e02-021/e02-021-00.png,"Incidentally , it is better to"
e02/e02-021/e02-021-01.png,complete any mortising that may be
e02/e02-021/e02-021-02.png,needed at the top before the tapering is
e02/e02-021/e02-021-03.png,begun . Some plain tapered legs have
e02/e02-021/e02-021-04.png,"the taper on the two inner faces only ,"
e02/e02-021/e02-021-05.png,the outer surfaces being vertical as
e02/e02-021/e02-021-06.png,"at ( B ) , Fig. 1 . To make a leg such as"
e02/e02-021/e02-021-07.png,"that at ( D ) , Fig. 1 , the square is first"
e02/e02-021/e02-021-08.png,"marked out as at ( A ) , Fig. 3 ."
e02/e02-025/e02-025-00.png,Note that squared lines marking
e02/e02-025/e02-025-01.png,the top member of the toe are
e02/e02-025/e02-025-02.png,needed as well as the upper ex-

e02/e02-025/e02-025-04.png,this case it is necessary to
e02/e02-025/e02-025-05.png,mark in the line of the taper
e02/e02-025/e02-025-06.png,with pencil and straight-edge
e02/e02-025/e02-025-07.png,"as at ( B ) , Fig. 3 . A saw cut is"
e02/e02-025/e02-025-08.png,made at the upper toe line
e02/e02-025/e02-025-09.png,"exactly down to the taper line ,"
e02/e02-074/e02-074-00.png,"But why woodwork in particular ? Well , there"
e02/e02-074/e02-074-01.png,are many reasons . Wood is in good and
e02/e02-074/e02-074-02.png,common supply ; it lends itself to making
e02/e02-074/e02-074-03.png,innumerable useful household items -
e02/e02-074/e02-074-04.png,"furniture , fitments , garden items , toys , etc. ;"
e02/e02-074/e02-074-05.png,it enables results to be obtained fairly
e02/e02-074/e02-074-06.png,quickly ; it is less expensive than most
e02/e02-074/e02-074-07.png,other materials ; it is a pleasant material
e02/e02-074/e02-074-08.png,"to work with ; and , although it does"
e02/e02-074/e02-074-09.png,"create a certain amount of mess , it is"
e02/e02-074/e02-074-10.png,all clean and easily cleared away .
e02/e02-082/e02-082-00.png,This last point is certainly important because almost
e02/e02-082/e02-082-01.png,everyone has come to recognise that machines
e02/e02-082/e02-082-02.png,"are not only an economic necessity , but that a"
e02/e02-082/e02-082-03.png,great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
e02/e02-082/e02-082-04.png,installation of a power tool . As an elementary
e02/e02-082/e02-082-05.png,"example , surely no one can pretend to enjoy"
e02/e02-082/e02-082-06.png,ripping out parts from hardwood . Most men
e02/e02-082/e02-082-07.png,would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
e02/e02-086/e02-086-00.png,"Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin"
e02/e02-086/e02-086-01.png,with what we have called a bare minimum kit . Probably
e02/e02-086/e02-086-02.png,most men have some of the tools already . It will enable
e02/e02-086/e02-086-03.png,"a man to make simple , straight-forward things , and in"
e02/e02-086/e02-086-04.png,any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
e02/e02-086/e02-086-05.png,which other tools can be added as the need arises . The
e02/e02-086/e02-086-06.png,nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
e02/e02-086/e02-086-07.png,"to be made , but as a guide we have given a fuller kit"
e02/e02-086/e02-086-08.png,which increases the range of things that can be
e02/e02-091/e02-091-00.png,"As a still further development , we follow"
e02/e02-091/e02-091-01.png,"with a good basic kit , which includes"
e02/e02-091/e02-091-02.png,"the fuller kit ( which in its turn , of course ,"
e02/e02-091/e02-091-03.png,includes the bare minimum kit ) .
e02/e02-091/e02-091-04.png,With this the vast majority of jobs
e02/e02-091/e02-091-05.png,"can be done , though for advanced"
e02/e02-091/e02-091-06.png,cabinet work the necessity for
e02/e02-091/e02-091-07.png,certain special tools will become
e02/e02-094/e02-094-00.png,"Lastly , we suggest certain power tools and"
e02/e02-094/e02-094-01.png,"machines , the choice of which will"
e02/e02-094/e02-094-02.png,depend partly upon the space available
e02/e02-094/e02-094-03.png,"in the workshop , the amount one"
e02/e02-094/e02-094-04.png,"is prepared to pay , and the type of"
e02/e02-094/e02-094-05.png,"work a man normally does . First ,"
e02/e02-094/e02-094-06.png,"however , a word of advice generally ."
e02/e02-094/e02-094-07.png,Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
e02/e02-094/e02-094-08.png,machines . They never are cheap in the
e02/e02-094/e02-094-09.png,"long run . They may be inaccurate ,"
e02/e02-100/e02-100-00.png,"Most tools have to lead an intensive life , and faults"
e02/e02-100/e02-100-01.png,in design or quality soon become apparent . It is far
e02/e02-100/e02-100-02.png,better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
e02/e02-100/e02-100-03.png,"quality , and not handicap yourself from the start ."
e02/e02-100/e02-100-04.png,"To put it in a slightly different way , do not allow"
e02/e02-100/e02-100-05.png,yourself to blame the tools when the job does
e02/e02-117/e02-117-00.png,Many men with only limited accommodation
e02/e02-117/e02-117-01.png,have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table .
e02/e02-117/e02-117-02.png,"Providing this is sound , some perfectly good"
e02/e02-117/e02-117-03.png,"work can be done on it , but the usual problems"
e02/e02-117/e02-117-04.png,"are those of the vice , the bench stop , and storage"
e02/e02-117/e02-117-05.png,place for tools . The combined bench top and
e02/e02-117/e02-117-06.png,tool cupboard shown here has been specially
e02/e02-117/e02-117-07.png,designed and made for WOODWORKER
e02/e02-117/e02-117-08.png,readers who have this difficulty .
e04/e04-000/e04-000-00.png,HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the
e04/e04-000/e04-000-01.png,family man or father-to-be . Unlike many
e04/e04-000/e04-000-02.png,"commercial articles , this chair is solidly built and"
e04/e04-000/e04-000-03.png,capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the
e04/e04-000/e04-000-04.png,most destructive youngster . Almost any available
e04/e04-000/e04-000-05.png,timber can be used but Parana pine is
e04/e04-000/e04-000-06.png,"recommended , being cheap , easy to work , and"
e04/e04-004/e04-004-00.png,Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
e04/e04-004/e04-004-01.png,timber as shown in Fig. 1 . Although the timber will have already
e04/e04-004/e04-004-02.png,"been machine planed , remember to go over each piece with"
e04/e04-004/e04-004-03.png,"a smoothing plane , otherwise the marks left by the cutters"
e04/e04-004/e04-004-04.png,will show up after painting . The dimensions given enable the
e04/e04-004/e04-004-05.png,"feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table , but the height"
e04/e04-008/e04-008-00.png,"All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned ,"
e04/e04-008/e04-008-01.png,which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat
e04/e04-008/e04-008-02.png,appearance . The side frames are joined by four cross pieces
e04/e04-008/e04-008-03.png,"each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses ( C ) ,"
e04/e04-011/e04-011-00.png,See Fig. 2 . These are then glued and
e04/e04-011/e04-011-01.png,pinned into place . A similar piece of 1 in.
e04/e04-011/e04-011-02.png,by 1 1/4 in. by 14 in. timber is fixed across
e04/e04-011/e04-011-03.png,the end of the feeding tray as seen in
e04/e04-011/e04-011-04.png,Fig. 3 which also shows how a piece of
e04/e04-011/e04-011-05.png,hardboard is covered with plastic material
e04/e04-011/e04-011-06.png,for easy cleaning and then fixed underneath
e04/e04-011/e04-011-07.png,the frame with panel pins to complete
e04/e04-015/e04-015-00.png,Cut this piece of hardboard so that it
e04/e04-015/e04-015-01.png,fits up against the front legs of the
e04/e04-015/e04-015-02.png,chair . The seat rests across the upper two
e04/e04-015/e04-015-03.png,cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood
e04/e04-015/e04-015-04.png,"glued and panel pinned in position , measurements"
e04/e04-015/e04-015-05.png,being taken directly from the work . Fig. 4
e04/e04-015/e04-015-06.png,shows the framework for the back which
e04/e04-015/e04-015-07.png,is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber .
e04/e04-019/e04-019-00.png,The amount of the backward tilt and
e04/e04-019/e04-019-01.png,also the height is left to personal choice
e04/e04-019/e04-019-02.png,and the width is best taken directly
e04/e04-019/e04-019-03.png,from the work to ensure a good fit .
e04/e04-019/e04-019-04.png,Fix the piece A to the sides first
e04/e04-019/e04-019-05.png,with glue and panel pins and then fit
e04/e04-019/e04-019-06.png,the frame together with the piece
e04/e04-019/e04-019-07.png,B temporarily in place on the chair
e04/e04-022/e04-022-00.png,"Decide on the required angle of slope ,"
e04/e04-022/e04-022-01.png,"keeping B flat on the chair seat , and mark"
e04/e04-022/e04-022-02.png,off the exact position of B on the side
e04/e04-022/e04-022-03.png,pieces . These can then be cut at the correct
e04/e04-022/e04-022-04.png,angle and B is glued and nailed in place .
e04/e04-022/e04-022-05.png,A piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned
e04/e04-022/e04-022-06.png,to the frame and its edges planed off
e04/e04-026/e04-026-00.png,Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with
e04/e04-026/e04-026-01.png,screws driven from the inside . The footrest is a
e04/e04-026/e04-026-02.png,piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in.
e04/e04-026/e04-026-03.png,by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair
e04/e04-026/e04-026-04.png,of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5 . When determining
e04/e04-026/e04-026-05.png,"the position of the footrest , do not place too near"
e04/e04-026/e04-026-06.png,the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs .
e04/e04-030/e04-030-00.png,"To complete the job , screw two fittings to the"
e04/e04-030/e04-030-01.png,inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the
e04/e04-030/e04-030-02.png,back to hold the baby's safety harness . These can be
e04/e04-030/e04-030-03.png,made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout
e04/e04-030/e04-030-04.png,wire as shown in Fig. 6 . Make sure that these
e04/e04-030/e04-030-05.png,are well secured as they will have to withstand
e04/e04-030/e04-030-06.png,considerable pulling as the child becomes older .
e04/e04-034/e04-034-00.png,Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes
e04/e04-034/e04-034-01.png,with plastic wood . Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole
e04/e04-034/e04-034-02.png,framework and round off any sharp edges ( such as the
e04/e04-034/e04-034-03.png,"edge of the seat , feeding tray , etc ) . Fill the grain with a"
e04/e04-034/e04-034-04.png,woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in
e04/e04-034/e04-034-05.png,"a suitable pastel shade , using a contrasting colour"
e04/e04-034/e04-034-06.png,for the seat and the back which can be decorated with
e04/e04-034/e04-034-07.png,a suitable nursery transfer .
e04/e04-038/e04-038-00.png,Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous
e04/e04-038/e04-038-01.png,"if junior decides to bite the chair . Finally , it is as well"
e04/e04-038/e04-038-02.png,to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective
e04/e04-038/e04-038-03.png,material that might be available as otherwise the
e04/e04-038/e04-038-04.png,paint would soon be scratched off .
e04/e04-038/e04-038-05.png,( J.H.P. ) BUILDING your own boat is a most
e04/e04-038/e04-038-06.png,satisfying and worthwhile project .
e04/e04-043/e04-043-00.png,Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
e04/e04-043/e04-043-01.png,rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
e04/e04-043/e04-043-02.png,sold . It is especially designed for simplicity in
e04/e04-043/e04-043-03.png,"construction , cheapness and lightness of weight ,"
e04/e04-043/e04-043-04.png,and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She
e04/e04-043/e04-043-05.png,weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
e04/e04-043/e04-043-06.png,and an outboard motor with a comfortable
e04/e04-052/e04-052-00.png,"For instance , in Canada we use galvanised nails"
e04/e04-052/e04-052-01.png,in place of screws . We just bend them over and clamp
e04/e04-052/e04-052-02.png,firmly by using a hammer on each side . Over here I 've
e04/e04-052/e04-052-03.png,"always used brass screws , which are more expensive . The first"
e04/e04-052/e04-052-04.png,"job is to make your moulds . In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply ,"
e04/e04-052/e04-052-05.png,"but to save money any scrap may be used , and if this"
e04/e04-052/e04-052-06.png,"is nailed and glued together strongly , it may be marked"
e04/e04-058/e04-058-00.png,If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
e04/e04-058/e04-058-01.png,"the moulds , make a frame of rough lumber as shown in"
e04/e04-058/e04-058-02.png,Fig. 2 . The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
e04/e04-058/e04-058-03.png,"rigid as possible , for it is on these you will be building"
e04/e04-058/e04-058-04.png,"and shaping your little craft , upside-down . For cheapness"
e04/e04-058/e04-058-05.png,I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
e04/e04-062/e04-062-00.png,This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure
e04/e04-062/e04-062-01.png,a permanently water proof glue line . Be sure to
e04/e04-062/e04-062-02.png,"see that the edge bears the mark , P.M.B.C. Exterior ."
e04/e04-062/e04-062-03.png,This may be bought at any good timber merchants .
e04/e04-062/e04-062-04.png,The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply
e04/e04-062/e04-062-05.png,"wood of the same make , or oak or mahogany . For the"
e04/e04-062/e04-062-06.png,"last one I made , I used the two flaps from an old"
e04/e04-062/e04-062-07.png,mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one
e04/e04-068/e04-068-00.png,I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
e04/e04-068/e04-068-01.png,"rowing this dinghy ( Fig. 3 ) . They are very simple , cheap"
e04/e04-068/e04-068-02.png,and easy to make . As will be seen from the plan
e04/e04-068/e04-068-03.png,there is only a single gunwale on the outside .
e04/e04-068/e04-068-04.png,I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada
e04/e04-068/e04-068-05.png,is difficult to obtain here and expensive . I overcome
e04/e04-068/e04-068-06.png,this in another way as shown in Fig. 4 .
e04/e04-079/e04-079-00.png,Cut the moulds and the
e04/e04-079/e04-079-01.png,transoms to shape as in the
e04/e04-079/e04-079-02.png,detailed drawings . If you have
e04/e04-079/e04-079-03.png,a wooden floor you can use
e04/e04-079/e04-079-04.png,' A ' frames fastened to the floor
e04/e04-079/e04-079-05.png,"if not , use a strong horizontal"
e04/e04-079/e04-079-06.png,frame that will sit firmly on
e04/e04-079/e04-079-07.png,the ground or concrete floor . I
e04/e04-079/e04-079-08.png,use a heavy old base as in
e04/e04-083/e04-083-00.png,The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to
e04/e04-083/e04-083-01.png,correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat .
e04/e04-083/e04-083-02.png,Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
e04/e04-083/e04-083-03.png,to allow for the chines to rest in these
e04/e04-083/e04-083-04.png,"notches , as they are not fastened to the"
e04/e04-083/e04-083-05.png,"moulds , which will only be used whilst"
e04/e04-083/e04-083-06.png,the hull is under construction .
e04/e04-086/e04-086-00.png,The chine is the long stringer on each side which
e04/e04-086/e04-086-01.png,is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves
e04/e04-086/e04-086-02.png,"cut in the moulds . Each chine is made of oak ,"
e04/e04-086/e04-086-03.png,"ash , spruce or any long grained flexible wood . I"
e04/e04-086/e04-086-04.png,prefer spruce when available . As will be seen
e04/e04-086/e04-086-05.png,"in the plan , the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in."
e04/e04-091/e04-091-00.png,The chines are morticed into this and butt up
e04/e04-091/e04-091-01.png,against the transom . Start at the bow and
e04/e04-091/e04-091-02.png,spring them both at the same time over the
e04/e04-091/e04-091-03.png,slots cut in the moulds and into the notches
e04/e04-091/e04-091-04.png,cut for this purpose in the stern or after

e04/e04-095/e04-095-00.png,"The skeleton of the boat will now take shape ,"
e04/e04-095/e04-095-01.png,and this is the time to check before making fast
e04/e04-095/e04-095-02.png,to see that nothing is distorted . Ensure that
e04/e04-095/e04-095-03.png,the outside measurements from transom to transom
e04/e04-095/e04-095-04.png,are equal on each side and that the transoms
e04/e04-095/e04-095-05.png,are parallel horizontally . Next bevel the chines
e04/e04-095/e04-095-06.png,with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly .
e04/e04-099/e04-099-00.png,Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the
e04/e04-099/e04-099-01.png,plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
e04/e04-099/e04-099-02.png,planing after fixing to the boat . Use your two
e04/e04-099/e04-099-03.png,lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
e04/e04-099/e04-099-04.png,"purpose , the sides from one , and the bottom from"
e04/e04-099/e04-099-05.png,the other . If care is taken not to waste the
e04/e04-099/e04-099-06.png,"ply , plenty of material is left over for the thwarts ."
e04/e04-103/e04-103-00.png,"Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready"
e04/e04-103/e04-103-01.png,"to plank the sides . Start again at the bows ,"
e04/e04-103/e04-103-02.png,clamping into position with a ' D ' clamp . Bend
e04/e04-103/e04-103-03.png,round the frame to the stern and clamp there . If
e04/e04-103/e04-103-04.png,you have a third clamp use it in the centre as
e04/e04-103/e04-103-05.png,"well . After generously covering with glue , screw"
e04/e04-103/e04-103-06.png,the sides to the transom framing and the chine .
e04/e04-109/e04-109-00.png,Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass ) or nail
e04/e04-109/e04-109-01.png,"with inch and a quarter galvanized nails , if"
e04/e04-109/e04-109-02.png,you are doing it that way . Use flat head screws
e04/e04-109/e04-109-03.png,about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in
e04/e04-109/e04-109-04.png,the 1/4 in. ply . Make a very small hole for
e04/e04-109/e04-109-05.png,the screw to allow for a good grip . Remember
e04/e04-114/e04-114-00.png,"Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom ,"
e04/e04-114/e04-114-01.png,which is cut in one piece . It should overlap just a

e04/e04-114/e04-114-03.png,screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
e04/e04-114/e04-114-04.png,necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
e04/e04-114/e04-114-05.png,the screws . I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
e04/e04-114/e04-114-06.png,"the bottom , both for screwing to the chines and"

e04/e04-119/e04-119-03.png,shift them right out of the way . Place the boat right side

e04/e04-124/e04-124-02.png,with vertical members as shown in the plans . Make the
e04/e04-124/e04-124-03.png,four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions
e04/e04-124/e04-124-04.png,before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put

e07/e07-072/e07-072-01.png,"since the end of the war , clay pots are"
e07/e07-072/e07-072-02.png,still in greatest demand . It is mostly
e07/e07-072/e07-072-03.png,in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
e07/e07-072/e07-072-04.png,"have made headway , and although"
e07/e07-072/e07-072-05.png,numerous small clay pots are used each
e07/e07-072/e07-072-06.png,"year , they are fewer than they were 10"
e07/e07-072/e07-072-07.png,years ago . In the larger sizes there is still
e07/e07-072/e07-072-08.png,no real substitute for clay that can be
e07/e07-072/e07-072-09.png,"obtained at a comparable price , except the"
e07/e07-072/e07-072-10.png,bituminized paper pots which are used on
e07/e07-072/e07-072-11.png,commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
e07/e07-076/e07-076-00.png,The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
e07/e07-076/e07-076-01.png,brittle nature ; even with reasonably careful
e07/e07-076/e07-076-02.png,"handling , the annual losses are often around"
e07/e07-076/e07-076-03.png,"10 per cent. , and where the handling and"
e07/e07-076/e07-076-04.png,"storage facilities are not too good , these"
e07/e07-076/e07-076-05.png,losses will be even greater . This does not
e07/e07-076/e07-076-06.png,"necessarily apply to the larger sizes , as"
e07/e07-076/e07-076-07.png,they are not quite so fragile as the
e07/e07-076/e07-076-08.png,smaller ones and are not normally thrown
e07/e07-076/e07-076-09.png,about in quite the same way .
e07/e07-079/e07-079-00.png,The storage problem puts clay pots at a
e07/e07-079/e07-079-01.png,definite disadvantage . They are fairly heavy
e07/e07-079/e07-079-02.png,and difficult things to accommodate and
e07/e07-079/e07-079-03.png,they must have some protection from severe
e07/e07-079/e07-079-04.png,"weather , which can be quite a headache in"
e07/e07-079/e07-079-05.png,a small garden . While admitting that

e07/e07-083/e07-083-01.png,wash clay pots is a definite factor in
e07/e07-083/e07-083-02.png,favour of their abolition ; in fact one
e07/e07-083/e07-083-03.png,young man was so wholehearted about this
e07/e07-083/e07-083-04.png,a few years ago that he made the headlines
e07/e07-083/e07-083-05.png,for having smashed a large number # to
e07/e07-083/e07-083-06.png,relieve his feelings . On the small-to-medium
e07/e07-083/e07-083-07.png,"establishment , it is a disagreeable chore"
e07/e07-083/e07-083-08.png,"which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm ,"
e07/e07-083/e07-083-09.png,whereas on larger establishments the pots
e07/e07-083/e07-083-10.png,can be sterilized or washed by machine .
e07/e07-086/e07-086-00.png,It is not easy to make an economic
e07/e07-086/e07-086-01.png,comparison between clay pots and the various
e07/e07-086/e07-086-02.png,substitutes ; the former may last indefinitely
e07/e07-086/e07-086-03.png,"with luck , while the latter are often"
e07/e07-086/e07-086-04.png,expendable used only once . Clay pots are
e07/e07-086/e07-086-05.png,efficient and congenial containers in which
e07/e07-086/e07-086-06.png,to grow plants . In their proper setting they
e07/e07-086/e07-086-07.png,"are not unattractive and , in spite of"
e07/e07-086/e07-086-08.png,"their shortcomings , most gardeners have"
e07/e07-086/e07-086-09.png,a nostalgic affection for them .
e07/e07-090/e07-090-00.png,"Present-day pots are better finished , do"
e07/e07-090/e07-090-01.png,not get dirty so readily and are easier to
e07/e07-090/e07-090-02.png,wash . The deep rims make for neater and
e07/e07-090/e07-090-03.png,"safer stacking , though they are still"
e07/e07-090/e07-090-04.png,expensive and still get broken . On the
e07/e07-090/e07-090-05.png,"other hand , there is really no replacement"
e07/e07-090/e07-090-06.png,"for the larger sizes , so they have the"
e07/e07-090/e07-090-07.png,decided advantage of being the only

e07/e07-094/e07-094-00.png,Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
e07/e07-094/e07-094-01.png,pots for plant raising . These are compressed blocks of
e07/e07-094/e07-094-02.png,"compost , made in a specially devised press to"
e07/e07-094/e07-094-03.png,simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot .
e07/e07-094/e07-094-04.png,"Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape , they"
e07/e07-094/e07-094-05.png,are made of the same compost as would have
e07/e07-094/e07-094-06.png,"been used in a pot , the # only difference being"
e07/e07-094/e07-094-07.png,that it is used in a slightly moister

e07/e07-098/e07-098-01.png,"in the normal way , the only real difference"
e07/e07-098/e07-098-02.png,being that more of the watering is done through a

e07/e07-098/e07-098-04.png,"of water . First-class plants of tomatoes ,"

e07/e07-098/e07-098-09.png,lupins and numerous others .
e07/e07-101/e07-101-00.png,One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
e07/e07-101/e07-101-01.png,one : the cost of a pot of any description is saved
e07/e07-101/e07-101-02.png,completely . Manufacturing the block and planting
e07/e07-101/e07-101-03.png,"it is very little more trouble than normal potting ,"
e07/e07-101/e07-101-04.png,"and a superior plant , which transplants more"
e07/e07-101/e07-101-05.png,"easily , is produced . The obvious limitation #"
e07/e07-101/e07-101-06.png,is that soil blocks can only be used for
e07/e07-101/e07-101-07.png,propagating ; there can be no progression to a
e07/e07-101/e07-101-08.png,larger block when the plant or seedling is ready

e07/e07-105/e07-105-05.png,"useful for short-term operations , but are"
e07/e07-105/e07-105-06.png,inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
e07/e07-108/e07-108-00.png,They are # quite useful for plants that are
e07/e07-108/e07-108-01.png,"despatched to market or direct to customers ,"
e07/e07-108/e07-108-02.png,their cheapness making them attractive to the
e07/e07-108/e07-108-03.png,nurseryman ; there is also considerable saving
e07/e07-108/e07-108-04.png,in carriage costs because of their lightness .
e07/e07-108/e07-108-05.png,There are many types of plastic pots available ;
e07/e07-108/e07-108-06.png,"some expensive , some quite cheap ; some good"
e07/e07-108/e07-108-07.png,and others not so good . A wide range of
e07/e07-108/e07-108-08.png,plants grow quite well in plastic pots and
e07/e07-108/e07-108-09.png,usually need less water than those in clay
e07/e07-112/e07-112-00.png,They are slightly more difficult to
e07/e07-112/e07-112-01.png,"manage , however , until a little experience"
e07/e07-112/e07-112-02.png,has been gained with them . Plastic pots
e07/e07-112/e07-112-03.png,"are usually more expensive than clay ones ,"
e07/e07-112/e07-112-04.png,but they are almost indestructible and
e07/e07-112/e07-112-05.png,will last a long time with normal care .
f01/f01-053/f01-053-00.png,The job of the teacher is to set the learner's
f01/f01-053/f01-053-01.png,vocabulary to work on the existing store
f01/f01-053/f01-053-02.png,so as to make it grow . He does not
f01/f01-053/f01-053-03.png,simply pack new things into the store .
f01/f01-053/f01-053-04.png,The solitary learner has to find out
f01/f01-053/f01-053-05.png,"how to do this for himself , with the help"
f01/f01-053/f01-053-06.png,of books . He uses his vocabulary to
f01/f01-053/f01-053-07.png,ask questions and uses the books to
f01/f01-058/f01-058-00.png,Thus learning how to learn means becoming
f01/f01-058/f01-058-01.png,"your own philosopher , your own psychologist"
f01/f01-058/f01-058-02.png,and your own teacher . You will then be
f01/f01-058/f01-058-03.png,a well-established learner and the world
f01/f01-058/f01-058-04.png,will be at your feet . Although the word
f01/f01-058/f01-058-05.png,""" mind "" has given rise to endless"
f01/f01-058/f01-058-06.png,controversy among philosophers and psycho-
f01/f01-058/f01-058-07.png,"logists , many of whom would like to"
f01/f01-058/f01-058-08.png,"abolish it from the dictionary , most"
f01/f01-058/f01-058-09.png,of us obstinately go on using it .
f01/f01-066/f01-066-00.png,And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
f01/f01-066/f01-066-01.png,""" mind "" vanishes , at any rate for some time . It seems very difficult"
f01/f01-066/f01-066-02.png,"to detach the mind from the brain , and all the biological ,"
f01/f01-066/f01-066-03.png,surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
f01/f01-066/f01-066-04.png,close connection . There is a lot to be said for keeping the
f01/f01-066/f01-066-05.png,"word "" soul "" to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable"
f01/f01-066/f01-066-06.png,essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
f01/f01-066/f01-066-07.png,"the body , and to reserve the more prosaic word "" mind "" for"
f01/f01-066/f01-066-08.png,the basis of all those experiences and phenomena which
f01/f01-066/f01-066-09.png,are clearly associated with the brain .
f01/f01-070/f01-070-00.png,Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
f01/f01-070/f01-070-01.png,"picture of this "" basis "" of mental phenomena ?"
f01/f01-070/f01-070-02.png,"The physicists have succeeded remarkably well ,"
f01/f01-070/f01-070-03.png,"with the atomic theory , in giving a clear and detailed"
f01/f01-070/f01-070-04.png,picture of the basis of such material phenomena
f01/f01-070/f01-070-05.png,"as chemical action , magnetism , the behaviour of"
f01/f01-070/f01-070-06.png,gases and so on . Where has psychology got to in its
f01/f01-070/f01-070-07.png,"theories of "" mind "" ? Are there any ultimate units"
f01/f01-070/f01-070-08.png,of mind akin to the atoms of matter ?
f01/f01-075/f01-075-00.png,At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
f01/f01-075/f01-075-01.png,be analysed into discrete bits . These bits were
f01/f01-075/f01-075-02.png,identified as elementary sensations . These were
f01/f01-075/f01-075-03.png,thought to combine together to form compound
f01/f01-075/f01-075-04.png,experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
f01/f01-075/f01-075-05.png,matter combine to form molecular compounds .
f01/f01-075/f01-075-06.png,But this view led to too many difficulties and
f01/f01-075/f01-075-07.png,was finally abandoned . Nevertheless the search
f01/f01-075/f01-075-08.png,for basic units of mind has gone on and will
f01/f01-075/f01-075-09.png,"doubtless continue , for it is the aim of science to"
f01/f01-081/f01-081-00.png,"We must beware , however , of supposing that there must be any"
f01/f01-081/f01-081-01.png,close analogy between the units of quite different
f01/f01-081/f01-081-02.png,sciences . For example the success of the atomic theory
f01/f01-081/f01-081-03.png,in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
f01/f01-081/f01-081-04.png,units of geometry must be points . It would be more
f01/f01-081/f01-081-05.png,correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of
f01/f01-085/f01-085-00.png,There have been many conflicting tendencies in
f01/f01-085/f01-085-01.png,psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
f01/f01-085/f01-085-02.png,we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
f01/f01-085/f01-085-03.png,concept which is current today . It is known as the schema .
f01/f01-085/f01-085-04.png,It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
f01/f01-085/f01-085-05.png,concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
f01/f01-085/f01-085-06.png,but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction .
f01/f01-135/f01-135-00.png,It is the tendency to get things
f01/f01-135/f01-135-01.png,the wrong way round . As a
f01/f01-135/f01-135-02.png,psychologist I am constantly
f01/f01-135/f01-135-03.png,encountering this tendency
f01/f01-135/f01-135-04.png,in friends and acquaintances .
f01/f01-135/f01-135-05.png,They think there is something
f01/f01-135/f01-135-06.png,"inevitably "" queer "" about psychology"
f01/f01-135/f01-135-07.png,and this feeling of queerness
f01/f01-135/f01-135-08.png,usually boils down to a quite
f01/f01-135/f01-135-09.png,mistaken belief that the
f01/f01-135/f01-135-10.png,psychologist first looks into ...
f01/f01-139/f01-139-00.png,"This is what I mean by "" getting things the wrong way"
f01/f01-139/f01-139-01.png,"round "" . He is far more likely to find out about how"
f01/f01-139/f01-139-02.png,his own mind works by looking at other people's .
f01/f01-139/f01-139-03.png,"For although looking inwards ( or "" introspecting """
f01/f01-139/f01-139-04.png,"as it is called ) , is not entirely ruled out ,"
f01/f01-139/f01-139-05.png,nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is
f01/f01-139/f01-139-06.png,one of the most unreliable methods of getting
f01/f01-143/f01-143-00.png,And so they prefer objective methods . Since they cannot
f01/f01-143/f01-143-01.png,directly look into the mental processes of another
f01/f01-143/f01-143-02.png,person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
f01/f01-143/f01-143-03.png,to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
f01/f01-143/f01-143-04.png,this behaviour . This is no more queer than the method
f01/f01-143/f01-143-05.png,"of the doctor who observes signs , and records symptoms ,"
f01/f01-143/f01-143-06.png,and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them .
f01/f01-147/f01-147-00.png,He may never have had the disease himself but he
f01/f01-147/f01-147-01.png,can nevertheless identify it . Similarly the psychologist has
f01/f01-147/f01-147-02.png,to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
f01/f01-147/f01-147-03.png,"all kinds of processes in other people , whether or not they"
f01/f01-147/f01-147-04.png,correspond with anything in his own experience . We know
f01/f01-147/f01-147-05.png,very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
f01/f01-147/f01-147-06.png,"provide our schemas , nor do we need to know as far as"
f01/f01-147/f01-147-07.png,psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
f02/f02-000/f02-000-00.png,"The numerically largest group , consisting of male"
f02/f02-000/f02-000-01.png,weekly wage-earners up to chargehand level

f02/f02-000/f02-000-05.png,revealing that there were ( at that time ) seven-

f02/f02-003/f02-003-03.png,the panel decided to seek further insight into the

f03/f03-174/f03-174-00.png,"So - see the next page ! Yes , they are waiting for you ."
f03/f03-174/f03-174-01.png,But there is no need to be frightened . The audience
f03/f03-174/f03-174-02.png,will eat out of your hand - if they like what
f03/f03-174/f03-174-03.png,you offer them . A good start will put them in a
f03/f03-174/f03-174-04.png,good humour . Ladies and gentlemen ! I 'm afraid
f03/f03-174/f03-174-05.png,I have not had much experience of public speaking .
f03/f03-182/f03-182-00.png,But that 's a terrible way to begin ! Why tell them you
f03/f03-182/f03-182-01.png,are a novice ? It 's their interest you want - not their
f03/f03-182/f03-182-02.png,sympathy . And you want to get it from the word
f03/f03-182/f03-182-03.png,GO ! Try something like this : It is said that tele-
f03/f03-182/f03-182-04.png,"vision keeps people at home . But you , at any"
f03/f03-182/f03-182-05.png,"rate , have proved that wrong . And they say , too ,"
f03/f03-182/f03-182-06.png,that television makes its appeal to those of lesser
f03/f03-191/f03-191-00.png,May I suggest that you have proved that
f03/f03-191/f03-191-01.png,right ! Congratulations ! And away you go into
f03/f03-191/f03-191-02.png,"your speech . Take some thought , too , for your ending ."
f03/f03-191/f03-191-03.png,Thank you for listening to me so patiently . A political
f03/f03-191/f03-191-04.png,candidate often used that finish . No wonder he
f03/f03-191/f03-191-05.png,didn't get in ! Instead he might have ended
f03/f03-191/f03-191-06.png,"this way : Well , those are my views ."
f04/f04-004/f04-004-00.png,When he learned what was causing the commotion he
f04/f04-004/f04-004-01.png,"became greatly alarmed , and after the body had been"
f04/f04-004/f04-004-02.png,taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his
f04/f04-004/f04-004-03.png,grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth
f04/f04-004/f04-004-04.png,"Camp , aged thirty-three , the girl who was to have"
f04/f04-004/f04-004-05.png,been his bride . There was little doubt of how
f04/f04-004/f04-004-06.png,"she had met her death , and even less that it"
f04/f04-007/f04-007-00.png,She had been struck several times with a blunt
f04/f04-007/f04-007-01.png,"instrument , and her head was smashed in ."
f04/f04-007/f04-007-02.png,"There were signs of a violent struggle , blood"
f04/f04-007/f04-007-03.png,"on the cushions and floor , and the remains"
f04/f04-007/f04-007-04.png,of her broken umbrella . But a pair of bone
f04/f04-007/f04-007-05.png,cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
f04/f04-007/f04-007-06.png,to provide the only possible clue to the killer .
f04/f04-011/f04-011-00.png,"The body was examined , and it was definitely"
f04/f04-011/f04-011-01.png,established that no sexual assault had taken place .
f04/f04-011/f04-011-02.png,It seemed probable that the motive had been
f04/f04-011/f04-011-03.png,"robbery , and this was further confirmed when a"
f04/f04-011/f04-011-04.png,check was made with the woman's relations in
f04/f04-011/f04-011-05.png,Hounslow . Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
f04/f04-011/f04-011-06.png,"Good Intent , a public-house in Walworth . Her day"
f04/f04-011/f04-011-07.png,"off was Thursday , and before coming up to London"
f04/f04-011/f04-011-08.png,"in the evening she had called on her two sisters ,"
f04/f04-011/f04-011-09.png,one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
f04/f04-011/f04-011-10.png,"other at Hounslow , where she kept a shop ."
f04/f04-016/f04-016-00.png,"Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon ,"
f04/f04-016/f04-016-01.png,"and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M. , where"
f04/f04-016/f04-016-02.png,"she had tea with her other sister , and then"
f04/f04-016/f04-016-03.png,went to catch the 7.42 . Her sister saw her
f04/f04-016/f04-016-04.png,"to the station , helping her with some of"
f04/f04-016/f04-016-05.png,her packages . This sister was able to establish
f04/f04-016/f04-016-06.png,that she had carried a green purse and
f04/f04-016/f04-016-07.png,had bought a railway ticket .
f04/f04-020/f04-020-00.png,"But both purse and ticket , and the packages , were gone when the body"
f04/f04-020/f04-020-01.png,was found at Waterloo . Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
f04/f04-020/f04-020-02.png,likely that she had been carrying much money . A porter at Hounslow
f04/f04-020/f04-020-03.png,supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
f04/f04-020/f04-020-04.png,"compartment when the train left , but this did not help much , since it"
f04/f04-020/f04-020-05.png,had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo .
f04/f04-024/f04-024-00.png,The police began a systematic search of the line -
f04/f04-024/f04-024-01.png,"no easy task , but one in which patience and method"
f04/f04-024/f04-024-02.png,paid off . At a spot on the embankment between
f04/f04-024/f04-024-03.png,Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
f04/f04-024/f04-024-04.png,"pestle such as chemists use , with some hairs"
f04/f04-024/f04-024-05.png,"sticking to it . The murder weapon , more than likely ,"
f04/f04-024/f04-024-06.png,and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a
f04/f04-028/f04-028-00.png,"But in 1897 , alas ! there was no fingerprint bureau ,"
f04/f04-028/f04-028-01.png,no experts to check and photograph any ' dabs ' it
f04/f04-028/f04-028-02.png,might have yielded . It was a tough case to
f04/f04-028/f04-028-03.png,"tackle , and Superintendent Robinson , of the L.S.W.R."
f04/f04-028/f04-028-04.png,"Police , and Chief Inspector Marshall , of Scotland"
f04/f04-028/f04-028-05.png,"Yard , combined forces in the investigation . While"
f04/f04-028/f04-028-06.png,accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been
f04/f04-028/f04-028-07.png,"attacked for the sake of robbery , they did not"
f04/f04-028/f04-028-08.png,overlook the possibility that this might have
f04/f04-028/f04-028-09.png,"disguised another motive , and a thorough check"
f04/f04-028/f04-028-10.png,of her former men friends and acquaintances began .
g01/g01-000/g01-000-00.png,A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was
g01/g01-000/g01-000-01.png,"imprisoned in England . His son , in revenge , was"
g01/g01-000/g01-000-02.png,"harrying English shipping as far away as Cherbourg ,"
g01/g01-000/g01-000-03.png,"and doing it to some purpose . John Philpot ,"
g01/g01-000/g01-000-04.png,one of that new class of merchant financiers
g01/g01-000/g01-000-05.png,"which the city of London was now producing , fitted ,"
g01/g01-000/g01-000-06.png,equipped and manned a fleet from his own
g01/g01-000/g01-000-07.png,"resources , and captured the young Mercer in a"
g04/g04-003/g04-003-00.png,Dr. Davidson said he would go for
g04/g04-003/g04-003-01.png,a walk over the fields while we attended
g04/g04-003/g04-003-02.png,"to our business . To my amusement ,"
g04/g04-003/g04-003-03.png,when we met at tea at the rectory
g04/g04-003/g04-003-04.png,"after the Dedication , the Archbishop"
g04/g04-003/g04-003-05.png,said he had been stopped by
g04/g04-003/g04-003-06.png,a farmer in a field . He seemed
g04/g04-003/g04-003-07.png,"rather indignant , but we took the"
g04/g04-003/g04-003-08.png,episode without a smile till afterwards .
g04/g04-007/g04-007-00.png,"The Hall proved most useful , especially in winter"
g04/g04-007/g04-007-01.png,when the distance to the church deterred many from
g04/g04-007/g04-007-02.png,coming to Sunday Evensong . We managed to furnish
g04/g04-007/g04-007-03.png,"a table with cross and candles , and the people"
g04/g04-007/g04-007-04.png,appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
g04/g04-007/g04-007-05.png,as for more secular purposes . In 1910 Dr. Talbot
g04/g04-007/g04-007-06.png,"was translated to Winchester , and Dr. Hubert"
g04/g04-007/g04-007-07.png,Burge became Bishop of Southwark .
g04/g04-011/g04-011-00.png,Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
g04/g04-011/g04-011-01.png,"work in connection with Higher Religious Education , and"
g04/g04-011/g04-011-02.png,to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
g04/g04-011/g04-011-03.png,Union . This meant organizing lectures and courses of
g04/g04-011/g04-011-04.png,"religious instruction through the Diocese , and I"
g04/g04-011/g04-011-05.png,also found myself a member of the Diocesan
g04/g04-011/g04-011-06.png,"Conference , where I remember introducing myself as"
g04/g04-011/g04-011-07.png,the incumbent of the highest church in the
g04/g04-014/g04-014-00.png,There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
g04/g04-014/g04-014-01.png,"some quarters , until I explained that my church"
g04/g04-014/g04-014-02.png,was 800 feet high above the sea level ! The
g04/g04-014/g04-014-03.png,"work was growing pretty heavy , and we managed"
g04/g04-014/g04-014-04.png,to get a stipendiary layman who could help
g04/g04-014/g04-014-05.png,among the children and young people .
g04/g04-017/g04-017-00.png,It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
g04/g04-017/g04-017-01.png,in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play . The place and its people were
g04/g04-017/g04-017-02.png,to play an important part in my life . For five years in succession till
g04/g04-017/g04-017-03.png,"war broke out in 1914 , I spent my summer holidays there and became"
g04/g04-017/g04-017-04.png,very intimate with the people and the environs . Every year between the
g04/g04-017/g04-017-05.png,"Passion Plays , an interval of ten years , another play would be"
g04/g04-017/g04-017-06.png,"performed at the small theatre in the village , when new talent would"
g04/g04-026/g04-026-00.png,First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had
g04/g04-026/g04-026-01.png,any idea of reading music . This was the village doctor who was an
g04/g04-026/g04-026-02.png,old school friend at Clifton . He could sustain the tenor part quite well
g04/g04-026/g04-026-03.png,and lead the others . As for basses and altos the conductor had to
g04/g04-026/g04-026-04.png,"teach by singing the parts with them . It was very amusing , and by"
g04/g04-026/g04-026-05.png,the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
g04/g04-026/g04-026-06.png,could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
g04/g04-032/g04-032-00.png,Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's
g04/g04-032/g04-032-01.png,"Wedding Feast . ' Enthusiasm grew , and in a few more months we"
g04/g04-032/g04-032-02.png,"gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster ,"
g04/g04-032/g04-032-03.png,and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector .
g04/g04-032/g04-032-04.png,"Friends from Limpsfield , in addition to the villagers , came up ,"
g04/g04-077/g04-077-00.png,Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
g04/g04-077/g04-077-01.png,were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen . Life was
g04/g04-077/g04-077-02.png,in those years more than busy . We now had a vicarage next
g04/g04-077/g04-077-03.png,"to the church , and I was most fortunate in having for eight"
g04/g04-077/g04-077-04.png,years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
g04/g04-077/g04-077-05.png,well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
g04/g04-081/g04-081-00.png,On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
g04/g04-081/g04-081-01.png,Purley she offered to come and look after me . She was
g04/g04-081/g04-081-02.png,"a real treasure , of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic"
g04/g04-081/g04-081-03.png,"things , a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy , '"
g04/g04-081/g04-081-04.png,who was the only other occupant of the house when
g04/g04-088/g04-088-00.png,We gathered together a splendid Sunday
g04/g04-088/g04-088-01.png,"afternoon service at the church , each child"
g04/g04-088/g04-088-02.png,"being given a number which , as they came into"
g04/g04-088/g04-088-03.png,"church , they could just whisper to"
g04/g04-088/g04-088-04.png,the superintendent who filled in the regi-
g04/g04-088/g04-088-05.png,ster at her own home . Each child had a
g04/g04-088/g04-088-06.png,picture given them and the lesson was
g04/g04-088/g04-088-07.png,largely based on this . It was on a
g04/g04-088/g04-088-08.png,stamp which could be stuck in
g04/g04-088/g04-088-09.png,"their book , and there was quite a"
g04/g04-088/g04-088-10.png,clamour for back stamps if a child
g04/g04-088/g04-088-11.png,had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause
g04/g04-092/g04-092-00.png,It was quite amusing to see how much
g04/g04-092/g04-092-01.png,"the children enjoyed the service , and I heard"
g04/g04-092/g04-092-02.png,of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
g04/g04-092/g04-092-03.png,naughty child with the penalty of not being
g04/g04-092/g04-092-04.png,allowed to come to the Children's Church
g04/g04-092/g04-092-05.png,on Sunday afternoon . I hope the threat
g04/g04-092/g04-092-06.png,"kept them good in the week , but anyway"
g04/g04-092/g04-092-07.png,"they were a most delightful lot , and"
g04/g04-092/g04-092-08.png,it is a great joy to meet them now
g04/g04-092/g04-092-09.png,fifty years afterwards when so many
g04/g04-092/g04-092-10.png,are parents or even grandparents
g04/g04-095/g04-095-00.png,Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
g04/g04-095/g04-095-01.png,me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
g04/g04-095/g04-095-02.png,lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
g04/g04-095/g04-095-03.png,continuing till old age to-day . When I went
g04/g04-095/g04-095-04.png,"to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was"
g04/g04-095/g04-095-05.png,"with the Vicar's Warden , Mr. F. W. Charlton"
g04/g04-095/g04-095-06.png,"and his family , the youngest of whose three"
g04/g04-095/g04-095-07.png,sons was just coming into the world in this year
g04/g04-098/g04-098-00.png,From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
g04/g04-098/g04-098-01.png,deep friendship which I have taken with me through
g04/g04-098/g04-098-02.png,all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry . Mr. and
g04/g04-098/g04-098-03.png,Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
g04/g04-098/g04-098-04.png,"years of war , when most lives were upset and"
g04/g04-098/g04-098-05.png,"some tempers were easily frayed , the most"
g04/g04-098/g04-098-06.png,loyal and devoted friends .
g04/g04-101/g04-101-00.png,Their homes - for since those years they have
g04/g04-101/g04-101-01.png,lived on in Purley - have always been
g04/g04-101/g04-101-02.png,"havens of rest , and the welcome has never"
g04/g04-101/g04-101-03.png,"failed . Their three boys , now successful men ,"
g04/g04-101/g04-101-04.png,were in our Children's Church from the
g04/g04-101/g04-101-05.png,"outset , and when we don't see one"
g04/g04-101/g04-101-06.png,another we do not forget .
g04/g04-104/g04-104-00.png,"In those early years 1914-18 , life was very full"
g04/g04-104/g04-104-01.png,both in the parish and in the wider war activities .
g04/g04-104/g04-104-02.png,"The Bishop , knowing that I spent my holidays in"
g04/g04-104/g04-104-03.png,"Bavaria , asked me if I would do something for two wards"
g04/g04-104/g04-104-04.png,"at the Royal Herbert Hospital , full of war prisoners ."
g04/g04-104/g04-104-05.png,"I was very glad to help in this way , and visited them"
g04/g04-104/g04-104-06.png,"frequently , establishing at once a friendly contact with"
g04/g04-104/g04-104-07.png,the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
g04/g04-104/g04-104-08.png,someone who knew their native villages .
g04/g04-108/g04-108-00.png,I could at once notice the great antagonism
g04/g04-108/g04-108-01.png,between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly
g04/g04-108/g04-108-02.png,scorned these more simple country folk .
g05/g05-087/g05-087-00.png,Less than no response from the Russian side led
g05/g05-087/g05-087-01.png,one to fear that the event might well have the
g05/g05-087/g05-087-02.png,outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
g05/g05-087/g05-087-03.png,lead to disaster . Then there had been much talk of
g05/g05-087/g05-087-04.png,the setting up among the German population of a
g05/g05-087/g05-087-05.png,"general system of "" francs-tireurs "" , to be named"

r06/r06-003/r06-003-03.png,is a smart but modest bar called Pierre's Bar . For one
r06/r06-003/r06-003-04.png,"day , with the help of the Syndicat d'Initiative , we had been"
r06/r06-003/r06-003-05.png,"hunting for furnished rooms , and had given up , when an"

r06/r06-003/r06-003-07.png,had firmly closed the door in our noses .

r06/r06-007/r06-007-02.png,she decided Pierre would solve our problems . This

r06/r06-011/r06-011-00.png,"We went in . There were a few people in the bar ,"
r06/r06-011/r06-011-01.png,"elderly , well-off , artistic , who , you felt , had made a hard"

r06/r06-018/r06-018-04.png,first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence .
r06/r06-018/r06-018-05.png,We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft
r06/r06-022/r06-022-00.png,"This was strange , even magic , because the owner's"
r06/r06-022/r06-022-01.png,"name was Pierre Tortorolo which , in Nicoison Italian means"
r06/r06-022/r06-022-02.png,' turtledove ' . Pierre Turtledove . When we woke up properly it
r06/r06-022/r06-022-03.png,"was raining , an even more hopeless rain than London , and we"
r06/r06-022/r06-022-04.png,looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the
r06/r06-022/r06-022-05.png,curling white breath of the mountains . The land looked
r06/r06-022/r06-022-06.png,like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her
r06/r06-027/r06-027-00.png,"There they were , in fact , below us , eight of them ."
r06/r06-027/r06-027-01.png,"Four of them were flattened on the window sills , two"

r06/r06-027/r06-027-03.png,We had a morning at Pierre's . He talked about people .
r06/r06-027/r06-027-04.png,Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named
r06/r06-027/r06-027-05.png,"Lawrence . He was here , near the railway station , three or"
r06/r06-027/r06-027-06.png,"four years . During this period he wrote a book ,"
r06/r06-035/r06-035-00.png,"No , he hadn't read it ; Madame did all the"
r06/r06-035/r06-035-01.png,reading . Lawrence died in this very place .
r06/r06-035/r06-035-02.png,He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and
r06/r06-035/r06-035-03.png,"again . No , he couldn't really remember"
r06/r06-035/r06-035-04.png,"him , he was one of the crowd . The"
r06/r06-035/r06-035-05.png,sun came out ; Mart went shopping ; I
r06/r06-035/r06-035-06.png,sat in the square reading the Patriote .
r06/r06-041/r06-041-00.png,There was a front-page rear-attack on de

r06/r06-041/r06-041-02.png,"to murders , apart for an outcry against a"

r06/r06-041/r06-041-04.png,the Mediterranean between Corsica and St
r06/r06-041/r06-041-05.png,Raphael . All the murders were well documented
r06/r06-041/r06-041-06.png,and had the air of being written by an

r06/r06-044/r06-044-06.png,before the father-in-law telephoned the police .
r06/r06-044/r06-044-07.png,"Then again , Monsieur V , owing to family"
r06/r06-044/r06-044-08.png,"troubles , had written to the local"
r06/r06-044/r06-044-09.png,"paper and the superintendent of police ,"
r06/r06-044/r06-044-10.png,informing them that he was on the point
r06/r06-049/r06-049-00.png,Monsieur V's house was immediately
r06/r06-049/r06-049-01.png,"surrounded by firemen and other officials ,"

r06/r06-049/r06-049-04.png,"apologising for the trouble , but explaining"
r06/r06-049/r06-049-05.png,that the walls were porous and the
r06/r06-049/r06-049-06.png,gas had escaped . General relief was
r06/r06-049/r06-049-07.png,"expressed , but Monsieur V ( this was"
r06/r06-049/r06-049-08.png,actually reported in the next issue ) returned
r06/r06-049/r06-049-09.png,"home and shot himself , leaving a note"
r06/r06-049/r06-049-10.png,which again left his household goods
r06/r06-053/r06-053-00.png,Some grim comic relief was provided by
r06/r06-053/r06-053-01.png,an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
r06/r06-053/r06-053-02.png,who hid himself in a bush and imitated
r06/r06-053/r06-053-03.png,a blackbird . Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
r06/r06-053/r06-053-04.png,was after this very bird and shot the farm-

r06/r06-053/r06-053-07.png,pellets were easily removed and the

r06/r06-057/r06-057-00.png,We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta .
r06/r06-057/r06-057-01.png,You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
r06/r06-057/r06-057-02.png,way . In the middle of the journey is a
r06/r06-057/r06-057-03.png,valley with a sea of vines and olives
r06/r06-057/r06-057-04.png,and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
r06/r06-057/r06-057-05.png,the hoe . Rising from the flecked sea are
r06/r06-057/r06-057-06.png,islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and
r06/r06-057/r06-057-07.png,"towns , grey , rose-headed mariners clinging"
r06/r06-057/r06-057-08.png,like limpets to the rock .
r06/r06-062/r06-062-00.png,There is a curd of morning smoke and
r06/r06-062/r06-062-01.png,a muffled bell taps the sky . Here we
r06/r06-062/r06-062-02.png,"stopped , as in fine weather we always"
r06/r06-062/r06-062-03.png,stopped . Down below is the village of
r06/r06-062/r06-062-04.png,"Cagnes , but between are pockets of"
r06/r06-062/r06-062-05.png,heat and cold like the hands of
r06/r06-062/r06-062-06.png,"friends or strangers , and a flurry of"
r06/r06-062/r06-062-07.png,"early smells , the dark bosoms of"
r06/r06-062/r06-062-08.png,beech and the thin pine fingers
r06/r06-066/r06-066-00.png,"Then here was Nice , and the old holiday"
r06/r06-066/r06-066-01.png,"sea , blue as a new school exercise"
r06/r06-066/r06-066-02.png,"book . The same old Nice , creamy ,"
r06/r06-066/r06-066-03.png,"vulgar , out of time , bitter-sweet with"
r06/r06-066/r06-066-04.png,the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
r06/r06-066/r06-066-05.png,"prostitutes , edging past grubby grandeur"
r06/r06-066/r06-066-06.png,"to the old sleeping port . This , and"
r06/r06-066/r06-066-07.png,"Paris , were my ruined pavilions , and I"
r06/r06-066/r06-066-08.png,could catch the taste of dead dreams on
r06/r06-066/r06-066-09.png,my tongue like spray .
r06/r06-070/r06-070-00.png,We parked the Lambretta opposite the
r06/r06-070/r06-070-01.png,"Negresco , and went to the beach to"
r06/r06-070/r06-070-02.png,have a swim . Amazing bedlam rocked
r06/r06-070/r06-070-03.png,"in our eyes . The sea boiled with waves ,"
r06/r06-070/r06-070-04.png,they galloped to the walls and spumed
r06/r06-070/r06-070-05.png,over the Promenade des Anglais . A huge
r06/r06-070/r06-070-06.png,crowd had collected . There were firemen
r06/r06-070/r06-070-07.png,"and policemen and ambulances , and the"
r06/r06-070/r06-070-08.png,eyes of the spectators were hard with
r06/r06-076/r06-076-00.png,They all had that neat look of
r06/r06-076/r06-076-01.png,Mediterranean people to whom nothing
r06/r06-076/r06-076-02.png,"could ever happen , the chosen sane , the"

r06/r06-076/r06-076-04.png,"disease and accident by doctors , God and"
r06/r06-076/r06-076-05.png,"the municipality . Yet , at any time now ,"
r06/r06-076/r06-076-06.png,the bell would ring for them - the gilded

r06/r06-076/r06-076-08.png,bloody child at the crossroads .
r06/r06-090/r06-090-00.png,It was growing cold . We left the
r06/r06-090/r06-090-01.png,crowd and drove back to Vence .
r06/r06-090/r06-090-02.png,The cool evening perfumes stood
r06/r06-090/r06-090-03.png,beckoning at the corners of the roads .
r06/r06-090/r06-090-04.png,Mart is unable to smell ( her sense
r06/r06-090/r06-090-05.png,"organs were impaired years ago ) , and"
r06/r06-090/r06-090-06.png,"I had to explain the low , sharp and"
r06/r06-090/r06-090-07.png,sweet signals in the air . When we
r06/r06-090/r06-090-08.png,got back home we felt exhausted .
r06/r06-090/r06-090-09.png,"London sickness ( a sense of guilt ,"
r06/r06-090/r06-090-10.png,mingled with the memory of sandwiches
r06/r06-097/r06-097-00.png,We went straight to bed and slept until
r06/r06-097/r06-097-01.png,the turtle-doves drummed up the

r06/r06-097/r06-097-03.png,"opposite Pierre's , I read about the Nice"
r06/r06-097/r06-097-04.png,beach catastrophe in the Patriote .
r06/r06-097/r06-097-05.png,"Mart had been right , the body had been"
r06/r06-097/r06-097-06.png,a woman's . It belonged to a Madame
r06/r06-097/r06-097-07.png,N. Enquiries had been made in the
r06/r06-097/r06-097-08.png,"neighbourhood , and it transpired that"
r06/r06-097/r06-097-09.png,Madame N's husband had made an
r06/r06-097/r06-097-10.png,arrangement with the dead lady's sister
r06/r06-103/r06-103-00.png,"The sister , able to swim , had returned"
r06/r06-103/r06-103-01.png,"to the shore , but instead of returning"
r06/r06-103/r06-103-02.png,to her brother-in-law ( with whom
r06/r06-103/r06-103-03.png,"she had an illicit relationship ) , she"
r06/r06-103/r06-103-06.png,"reported her to the police , and then jumped"
r06/r06-103/r06-103-07.png,off a cliff near Monte Carlo .
r06/r06-106/r06-106-00.png,The day I promised to take Catherine
r06/r06-106/r06-106-01.png,down to visit my young friend Philip
r06/r06-106/r06-106-02.png,"at his school in the country , we were"
r06/r06-106/r06-106-03.png,"to leave at eleven , but she arrived"
r06/r06-106/r06-106-04.png,"at nine . Her blue dress was new ,"
r06/r06-106/r06-106-05.png,and so were her fashionable shoes . Her
r06/r06-106/r06-106-06.png,hair had just been done . She looked
r06/r06-106/r06-106-07.png,more than ever like a pink and gold
r06/r06-106/r06-106-08.png,Renoir girl who expects everything from
r06/r06-111/r06-111-00.png,Catherine lives in a white house
r06/r06-111/r06-111-01.png,overlooking the sweeping brown tides
r06/r06-111/r06-111-02.png,of the river . She helped me clean up my
r06/r06-111/r06-111-03.png,flat with a devotion which said that
r06/r06-111/r06-111-04.png,she felt small flats were altogether more
r06/r06-111/r06-111-05.png,romantic than large houses . We drank
r06/r06-111/r06-111-06.png,"tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who ,"
r06/r06-111/r06-111-07.png,"being 15 , has pure stern tastes in every-"
r06/r06-111/r06-111-08.png,thing from food to music .
r06/r06-115/r06-115-00.png,Catherine looked at the books lying
r06/r06-115/r06-115-01.png,"around his room , and asked if she"
r06/r06-115/r06-115-02.png,might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
r06/r06-115/r06-115-03.png,to read on the train . Catherine is 13 .
r06/r06-115/r06-115-04.png,I suggested she might find them dif-
r06/r06-115/r06-115-05.png,"ficult , but she said , ' Philip reads them ,"
r06/r06-115/r06-115-06.png,doesn't he ? ' During the journey I read
r06/r06-115/r06-115-07.png,newspapers and watched her pretty
r06/r06-115/r06-115-08.png,frowning face as she turned the
r06/r06-115/r06-115-09.png,"pages of Babel , for she was determined"
r06/r06-115/r06-115-10.png,to let nothing get between her and
r06/r06-121/r06-121-00.png,"At the school , which is charming , ci-"
r06/r06-121/r06-121-01.png,"vilised and expensive , the two children"
r06/r06-121/r06-121-02.png,"walked together across green fields , and"
r06/r06-121/r06-121-03.png,"I followed , seeing how the sun gilded"
r06/r06-121/r06-121-04.png,their bright friendly heads turned
r06/r06-121/r06-121-05.png,towards each other as they talked . In
r06/r06-121/r06-121-06.png,Catherine's left hand she carried the
r06/r06-121/r06-121-07.png,stories of Isaac Babel . After lunch we
r06/r06-121/r06-121-08.png,went to the pictures . Philip allowed
r06/r06-121/r06-121-09.png,# it to be seen that he thought going to
r06/r06-121/r06-121-10.png,the pictures just for the fun of it was
r06/r06-126/r06-126-00.png,For his sake we chose the more
r06/r06-126/r06-126-01.png,serious of the two films that were
r06/r06-126/r06-126-02.png,showing in the little town . It was
r06/r06-126/r06-126-03.png,about a good priest who helped cri-
r06/r06-126/r06-126-04.png,"minals in New York . His goodness , how-"
r06/r06-126/r06-126-05.png,"ever , was not enough to prevent one"
r06/r06-126/r06-126-06.png,of them from being sent to the gas
r06/r06-126/r06-126-07.png,chamber ; and Philip and I waited with
r06/r06-126/r06-126-08.png,Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
r06/r06-126/r06-126-09.png,crying and could face the light of a golden
r06/r06-130/r06-130-00.png,At the entrance of the cinema the
r06/r06-130/r06-130-01.png,doorman was lying in wait for anyone
r06/r06-130/r06-130-02.png,who had red eyes . Grasping Catherine
r06/r06-130/r06-130-03.png,"by her suffering arm , he said bitterly :"
r06/r06-130/r06-130-04.png,"' Yes , why are you crying , he had to be"
r06/r06-130/r06-130-05.png,"punished for his crime , didn't he ? ' Cathe-"
r06/r06-130/r06-130-06.png,"rine stared at him , incredulous . Philip"
r06/r06-130/r06-130-07.png,rescued her by saying with disdain :
r06/r06-130/r06-130-08.png,' Some people don't know right from wrong
r06/r06-130/r06-130-09.png,even when its demonstrated to them . '
r06/r06-137/r06-137-00.png,The doorman turned his attention
r06/r06-137/r06-137-01.png,to the next red-eyed emerger from the
