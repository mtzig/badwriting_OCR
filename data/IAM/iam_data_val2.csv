d01/d01-016/d01-016-01.png,the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
d01/d01-016/d01-016-02.png,"plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote ."
d01/d01-016/d01-016-03.png,The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel .
d01/d01-019/d01-019-00.png,There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
d01/d01-019/d01-019-01.png,Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations . The
d01/d01-019/d01-019-02.png,present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history . The
d01/d01-019/d01-019-03.png,"original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was"
d01/d01-019/d01-019-04.png,"accidentally damaged . An editor , who was not the author , made what he"
d01/d01-019/d01-019-05.png,"could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order ."
d01/d01-024/d01-024-00.png,Most of those who expound a theory of textual
d01/d01-024/d01-024-01.png,dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
d01/d01-024/d01-024-02.png,written entirely by one author before the
d01/d01-024/d01-024-03.png,disturbance took place but a few leave it open
d01/d01-024/d01-024-04.png,to suppose that the original book had been
d01/d01-024/d01-024-05.png,revised even before the upheaval . The ingenuity
d01/d01-024/d01-024-06.png,of the theories is impressive and is the best
d01/d01-049/d01-049-00.png,The one real weakness of the Commentator's
d01/d01-049/d01-049-01.png,"case is that , in common with all his colleagues ,"
d01/d01-049/d01-049-02.png,"he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly"
d01/d01-049/d01-049-03.png,how this enlargement was effected nor has he
d01/d01-049/d01-049-04.png,been able to explain the textual movements by
d01/d01-049/d01-049-05.png,showing that such changes are part of a
d01/d01-049/d01-049-06.png,simple and coherent plan . To understand how
d01/d01-049/d01-049-07.png,this is possible it is necessary to examine the
d01/d01-052/d01-052-00.png,THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
d01/d01-052/d01-052-01.png,written in Greek . A modern text of the
d01/d01-052/d01-052-02.png,Gospel represents the work of generations of
d01/d01-052/d01-052-03.png,scholars who have compared the many manu-
d01/d01-052/d01-052-04.png,scripts of John and worked out the version
d01/d01-052/d01-052-05.png,which is most likely to have been the original
d01/d01-052/d01-052-06.png,wording . It is not possible to establish any one
d01/d01-052/d01-052-07.png,text with absolute precision .
d01/d01-056/d01-056-00.png,The most convenient one for the authors
d01/d01-056/d01-056-01.png,has been the text of A. Souter . In this
d01/d01-056/d01-056-02.png,version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
d01/d01-056/d01-056-03.png,"printed as just over 1,000 different nouns ,"
d01/d01-056/d01-056-04.png,"verbs , and other parts of speech occurring"
d01/d01-056/d01-056-05.png,"15,695 times in their different grammatical"
d01/d01-056/d01-056-06.png,forms . There are other texts which could
d01/d01-056/d01-056-07.png,"have been used , and ( as shown in Table 1 )"
d01/d01-056/d01-056-08.png,it is not a matter of the greatest importance
d01/d01-060/d01-060-00.png,At first sight the difference between
d01/d01-060/d01-060-01.png,Souter and the other texts is rather
d01/d01-060/d01-060-02.png,large . But the British text includes
d01/d01-060/d01-060-03.png,"the paragraph 7.53-8.11 , the Woman"
d01/d01-060/d01-060-04.png,"taken in Adultery , and this accounts"
d01/d01-060/d01-060-05.png,"for 178 words out of 279 , which is"
d01/d01-060/d01-060-06.png,"the difference between the 15,695 words"
d01/d01-060/d01-060-07.png,"of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's ."
d01/d01-060/d01-060-08.png,The omission or inclusion of this paragraph
d01/d01-060/d01-060-09.png,is a matter of editorial decision rather
d01/d01-080/d01-080-00.png,"The bar was the commonest marking , but others"
d01/d01-080/d01-080-01.png,were also used . Dots sometimes served in place of the
d01/d01-080/d01-080-02.png,"bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as"
d01/d01-080/d01-080-03.png,it is now used to mark a paragraph ending . Frequently
d01/d01-080/d01-080-04.png,paragraphos markings were omitted . C. H. Roberts is of
d01/d01-080/d01-080-05.png,the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
d01/d01-080/d01-080-06.png,"some markings would be used , although which , it is"
d01/d01-085/d01-085-00.png,Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
d01/d01-085/d01-085-01.png,the original of the Gospel would be unmarked . The
d01/d01-085/d01-085-02.png,"original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,"
d01/d01-085/d01-085-03.png,"whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in"
d01/d01-085/d01-085-04.png,columns . This is the invariable practice of ancient
d01/d01-085/d01-085-05.png,manuscripts . A common size of column would hold
d01/d01-085/d01-085-06.png,about one third of a page of Souter's print .
d01/d01-098/d01-098-00.png,The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
d01/d01-098/d01-098-01.png,and the sheet wound round this central pin . The roll made
d01/d01-098/d01-098-02.png,a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number
d01/d01-098/d01-098-03.png,which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
d01/d01-098/d01-098-04.png,this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It
d01/d01-098/d01-098-05.png,"was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not"
d01/d01-098/d01-098-06.png,an easy form of book in which to find a
d01/d01-104/d01-104-00.png,This last objection might have had some weight in
d01/d01-104/d01-104-01.png,"ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,"
d01/d01-104/d01-104-02.png,the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
d01/d01-104/d01-104-03.png,As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
d01/d01-104/d01-104-04.png,"overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his"
d01/d01-104/d01-104-05.png,information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
d01/d01-104/d01-104-06.png,The other form of book was the codex . In this the
d01/d01-104/d01-104-07.png,sheets were bound together down one edge much as
d01/d01-118/d01-118-00.png,Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
d01/d01-118/d01-118-01.png,might be bulky . It is sometimes possible to tell
d01/d01-118/d01-118-02.png,whether or not a particular text was written on
d01/d01-118/d01-118-03.png,a roll or a codex . Rolls were prepared for
d01/d01-118/d01-118-04.png,"writing , but any papyrus left unused at the"
d01/d01-118/d01-118-05.png,end could be cut off . If the text was longer than
d01/d01-118/d01-118-06.png,"the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on ."
d01/d01-123/d01-123-00.png,"The verso of the roll was blank , and one"
d01/d01-123/d01-123-01.png,"cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,"
d01/d01-123/d01-123-02.png,"sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,"
d01/d01-123/d01-123-03.png,while one whole side of his roll was unused .
d01/d01-123/d01-123-04.png,The codex form was not so accommodating . Even
d01/d01-123/d01-123-05.png,"in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra"
d01/d01-123/d01-123-06.png,sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
d01/d01-123/d01-123-07.png,"over the binding , or the whole codex rebound ."
d03/d03-112/d03-112-00.png,Close to the building projects would be the
d03/d03-112/d03-112-01.png,VINEYARDS ( 1 Kings 4.25 ; S. of Sol. 8.11 ) .

d03/d03-112/d03-112-03.png,"pairi-deaza , from which our word paradise"
d03/d03-112/d03-112-04.png,is derived . Qoheleth has a second
d03/d03-112/d03-112-05.png,paradise at his disposal but he is
d03/d03-112/d03-112-06.png,no happier than Adam was !
d03/d03-112/d03-112-07.png,The word is used in the singular

d05/d05-021/d05-021-05.png,"definite . It was at this time , too , that King James made"
d05/d05-021/d05-021-06.png,himself immortal by becoming associated with
d05/d05-021/d05-021-07.png,a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
d05/d05-021/d05-021-08.png,( which was never actually authorized ! ) .
d05/d05-025/d05-025-00.png,In that year Shakespeare had just turned
d05/d05-025/d05-025-01.png,forty and had written Hamlet two years
d05/d05-025/d05-025-02.png,before . Bacon was at work and Milton was
d05/d05-025/d05-025-03.png,just learning to read . James was followed by
d05/d05-025/d05-025-04.png,"Charles , in whose reign came the Scottish"
d05/d05-025/d05-025-05.png,Prayer Book in 1637 . Significantly this made
d05/d05-025/d05-025-06.png,a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
d05/d05-025/d05-025-07.png,became the foster mother of some of the most
d05/d05-025/d05-025-08.png,important Prayer Books in the Anglican
d05/d05-030/d05-030-00.png,"Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud ,"
d05/d05-030/d05-030-01.png,now so much nobler a figure than former historians
d05/d05-030/d05-030-02.png,led us to believe . Laud was enthusiastically hated
d05/d05-030/d05-030-03.png,"by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was"
d05/d05-030/d05-030-04.png,mutual . But Laud was no Romanizer . One of his
d05/d05-030/d05-030-05.png,first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
d05/d05-030/d05-030-06.png,"the Jesuit , Fisher . But anyone who was friendly"
d05/d05-030/d05-030-07.png,"with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,"
d05/d05-030/d05-030-08.png,was necessarily a menace .
d05/d05-040/d05-040-00.png,Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church ?
d05/d05-040/d05-040-01.png,Laud made a positive approach . He set out to increase
d05/d05-040/d05-040-02.png,a sense of reverence . The Prayer Book was to be respected
d05/d05-040/d05-040-03.png,and so was the office of a bishop . Altars should be
d05/d05-040/d05-040-04.png,"altars and not any broken down , transportable"
d05/d05-040/d05-040-05.png,table which was handy for the most improbable uses .
d06/d06-000/d06-000-00.png,In the first place it is not a great deal
d06/d06-000/d06-000-01.png,"of use telling even children , as I have"
d06/d06-000/d06-000-02.png,"already suggested , not to be silly or"
d06/d06-000/d06-000-03.png,to pull themselves together . Far better
d06/d06-000/d06-000-04.png,to help them to face whatever it is that
d06/d06-000/d06-000-05.png,"is worrying them , to find the original"
d06/d06-000/d06-000-06.png,cause and then deal with it ; show it
d06/d06-000/d06-000-07.png,up either for the sham it is - and many
d06/d06-000/d06-000-08.png,fears are based upon completely
d06/d06-000/d06-000-09.png,irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
d06/d06-003/d06-003-00.png,Even worse is to laugh . Tremendous damage may be done to a child
d06/d06-003/d06-003-01.png,"by laughing at what are very real fears . As adults , we know"
d06/d06-003/d06-003-02.png,"that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable ,"
d06/d06-003/d06-003-03.png,but to a child they are very real . Not that I am suggesting
d06/d06-003/d06-003-04.png,that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
d06/d06-003/d06-003-05.png,"to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the"
d06/d06-008/d06-008-00.png,To ridicule them only pushes them farther
d06/d06-008/d06-008-01.png,"into themselves , so that they become"
d06/d06-008/d06-008-02.png,unable to speak about it to anybody and
d06/d06-008/d06-008-03.png,"the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown ,"
d06/d06-008/d06-008-04.png,the harvest of which may still be being
d06/d06-008/d06-008-05.png,reaped at forty or fifty . Far better to
d06/d06-008/d06-008-06.png,agree with a child that a particular
d06/d06-008/d06-008-07.png,"situation is frightening , and then to face"
d06/d06-008/d06-008-08.png,it together until the child can see how
d06/d06-008/d06-008-09.png,unnecessary its fears were .
d06/d06-011/d06-011-00.png,Because situations which may contain
d06/d06-011/d06-011-01.png,"all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,"
d06/d06-011/d06-011-02.png,it is a good idea to condition a child
d06/d06-011/d06-011-03.png,to some extent against it . To keep a child
d06/d06-011/d06-011-04.png,of twelve or thirteen under the
d06/d06-011/d06-011-05.png,impression that nothing nasty ever
d06/d06-011/d06-011-06.png,"happens is not merely dishonest , it"
d06/d06-011/d06-011-07.png,is unwise . As I shall suggest in a
d06/d06-011/d06-011-08.png,later chapter there are some situations
d06/d06-011/d06-011-09.png,which occur less frequently than
d06/d06-015/d06-015-00.png,"A little more honesty , even if one refrains from going into"
d06/d06-015/d06-015-01.png,"too many details , would help many a child to make a"
d06/d06-015/d06-015-02.png,proper adjustment to life as it grows up . Let us look
d06/d06-015/d06-015-03.png,"at Jesus . We do not , I think , see there a life without fear ."
d06/d06-015/d06-015-04.png,There are several instances where he seemed unable to go
d06/d06-020/d06-020-00.png,In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
d06/d06-020/d06-020-01.png,should pass from Him . Jesus shows us
d06/d06-020/d06-020-02.png,the way to face life . To see all the latent
d06/d06-020/d06-020-03.png,frightening possibilities and yet by facing
d06/d06-020/d06-020-04.png,them and knowing God is with us and
d06/d06-020/d06-020-05.png,"that , with Him , there is nothing that can"
d06/d06-020/d06-020-06.png,"finally defeat us . More than that , that God"
d06/d06-020/d06-020-07.png,has something important to do with our
d06/d06-020/d06-020-08.png,"lives and that the nearer we get to Him ,"
d06/d06-020/d06-020-09.png,the stronger we become .
d06/d06-025/d06-025-00.png,... Today A wonderful thought In the
d06/d06-025/d06-025-01.png,dawn was given ... And the thought
d06/d06-025/d06-025-02.png,Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in
d06/d06-025/d06-025-03.png,"my hand ; That my hand is big Big ,"
d06/d06-025/d06-025-04.png,"Because of the plan That God , Who"
d06/d06-025/d06-025-05.png,"dwells in my hand , Knows this"
d06/d06-025/d06-025-06.png,"secret plan , Of the things He will"
d06/d06-025/d06-025-07.png,do for the world Using my hand .
d06/d06-027/d06-027-00.png,"Toyohiko Kagawa . Loving Saviour , who experienced"
d06/d06-027/d06-027-01.png,"all human emotion , and whose sensitive"
d06/d06-027/d06-027-02.png,"nature knows better than we do , what it is to"
d06/d06-027/d06-027-03.png,"be really afraid , help us to know that when"
d06/d06-027/d06-027-04.png,"we face life boldly , many of the shadows are"
d06/d06-027/d06-027-05.png,"seen to be allies and not enemies and that ,"
d06/d06-027/d06-027-06.png,"come what may , we are never alone when"
d06/d06-030/d06-030-00.png,Amen . MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
d06/d06-030/d06-030-01.png,purely physical thing . The cure for which is sleep . This is only
d06/d06-030/d06-030-02.png,partly true . Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
d06/d06-030/d06-030-03.png,"amount of rest seems to make any difference . Sleep , to be"
d06/d06-030/d06-030-04.png,"effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes"
d06/d06-037/d06-037-00.png,"To others , the long hours of the night bring"
d06/d06-037/d06-037-01.png,only a disturbed tossing and turning
d06/d06-037/d06-037-02.png,which causes them to wake feeling worse
d06/d06-037/d06-037-03.png,than when they went to bed . We may begin
d06/d06-037/d06-037-04.png,to understand this a little better when we
d06/d06-037/d06-037-05.png,realize that tiredness itself is largely in
d06/d06-037/d06-037-06.png,"the mind . Very few people , under normal"
d06/d06-037/d06-037-07.png,"conditions , work themselves to a standstill ."
d06/d06-041/d06-041-00.png,The mind tires first and conveys the impression
d06/d06-041/d06-041-01.png,of tiredness to the body . This can be proved by
d06/d06-041/d06-041-02.png,noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
d06/d06-041/d06-041-03.png,body who feels thoroughly tired . Suppose
d06/d06-041/d06-041-04.png,a mother has news late at night that her
d06/d06-041/d06-041-05.png,child is in danger . She will undertake a
d06/d06-041/d06-041-06.png,"journey which , an hour before , she would"
d06/d06-041/d06-041-07.png,have declared impossible .
d06/d06-046/d06-046-00.png,"Even more simply , test your own reactions"
d06/d06-046/d06-046-01.png,to different situations . There are some which
d06/d06-046/d06-046-02.png,bring on an almost immediate feeling of
d06/d06-046/d06-046-03.png,tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
d06/d06-046/d06-046-04.png,"the washing-up - while others , if they"
d06/d06-046/d06-046-05.png,"refer to something you like doing , bring a"
d06/d06-046/d06-046-06.png,veritable surge of energy . Many a girl who
d06/d06-046/d06-046-07.png,is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump
d06/d06-046/d06-046-08.png,up with no apparent tiredness at all when
d06/d06-046/d06-046-09.png,her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
d06/d06-050/d06-050-00.png,Nor is she necessarily being deceitful . She really did feel tired
d06/d06-050/d06-050-01.png,until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
d06/d06-050/d06-050-02.png,"attractive - interest ! Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do"
d06/d06-050/d06-050-03.png,with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion . A
d06/d06-050/d06-050-04.png,disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
d06/d06-050/d06-050-05.png,"of fatigue . They wonder why they get no rest at night ,"
d06/d06-056/d06-056-00.png,They drag themselves around and can become
d06/d06-056/d06-056-01.png,a burden to their families and their friends .
d06/d06-056/d06-056-02.png,Any mental confusion can cause this and
d06/d06-056/d06-056-03.png,the best way is probably to seek advice .
d06/d06-056/d06-056-04.png,As we are unable to cure our own bodies
d06/d06-056/d06-056-05.png,"if the cause of our pain is too deep seated ,"
d06/d06-056/d06-056-06.png,"so we are unable to cure our own minds ,"
d06/d06-056/d06-056-07.png,if the trouble is a complicated one
d06/d06-056/d06-056-08.png,involving careful and patient treatment .
d06/d06-060/d06-060-00.png,One of the greatest steps forward that has been
d06/d06-060/d06-060-01.png,made this century is the way in which illness
d06/d06-060/d06-060-02.png,"of the mind is no longer feared or shunned ,"
d06/d06-060/d06-060-03.png,and is in fact no differently regarded than
d06/d06-060/d06-060-04.png,"physical illness . There is , nevertheless , a"
d06/d06-060/d06-060-05.png,great deal of tiredness which comes from
d06/d06-060/d06-060-06.png,no major complication but results from an
d06/d06-060/d06-060-07.png,"inability to deal with life , especially under"
d06/d06-060/d06-060-08.png,the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
d06/d06-063/d06-063-00.png,"In the days when most people were born ,"
d06/d06-063/d06-063-01.png,lived and died within the boundaries of
d06/d06-063/d06-063-02.png,"the village , it was not difficult for anybody"
d06/d06-063/d06-063-03.png,to live a day at a time . Even those who
d06/d06-063/d06-063-04.png,held a high and responsible office lived in
d06/d06-063/d06-063-05.png,far greater simplicity than their successors .
d06/d06-063/d06-063-06.png,"When news from the Continent took days ,"
d06/d06-063/d06-063-07.png,"from America weeks , from the Far East ,"
d06/d06-063/d06-063-08.png,"months , even a Prime Minister could go to"
d06/d06-063/d06-063-09.png,sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
d06/d06-063/d06-063-10.png,"be happening at the other end of England ,"
d06/d06-067/d06-067-00.png,"In other ways , too , life for the ordinary"
d06/d06-067/d06-067-01.png,individual has become so complex
d06/d06-067/d06-067-02.png,that it taxes the mind . Two hundred
d06/d06-067/d06-067-03.png,"years ago , men lived and worked"
d06/d06-067/d06-067-04.png,"in one place , their lives were of one"
d06/d06-067/d06-067-05.png,"piece . Now a man may live twenty ,"
d06/d06-067/d06-067-06.png,thirty even sixty miles from his
d06/d06-067/d06-067-07.png,work . The only connexion is the
d06/d06-067/d06-067-08.png,pipeline of the railway on which they
d06/d06-072/d06-072-00.png,"In many cases , their homes know little of"
d06/d06-072/d06-072-01.png,their place of work and their associates at
d06/d06-072/d06-072-02.png,the office or works wonder what they
d06/d06-072/d06-072-03.png,are possibly like in the surroundings of their
d06/d06-072/d06-072-04.png,"homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead"
d06/d06-072/d06-072-05.png,a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
d06/d06-072/d06-072-06.png,planning to do so or in fact being conscious
d06/d06-072/d06-072-07.png,of what is going on . It is easier to live life in
d06/d06-072/d06-072-08.png,"compartments but over the years it builds up ,"
d06/d06-072/d06-072-09.png,and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
d06/d06-072/d06-072-10.png,need to be handled correctly .
d06/d06-076/d06-076-00.png,Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life
d06/d06-076/d06-076-01.png,"as fully as possible , without having our energy sapped by un-"
d06/d06-076/d06-076-02.png,necessary weariness . ( a ) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness .
d06/d06-076/d06-076-03.png,We have a saying ' My head will never save my feet ' . Time
d06/d06-076/d06-076-04.png,after time we forget something and have to go back
d06/d06-082/d06-082-00.png,If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -
d06/d06-082/d06-082-01.png,we lose this way in the course of a day we would be
d06/d06-082/d06-082-02.png,"staggered . Some of it is inevitable , and we do not want to"
d06/d06-082/d06-082-03.png,"become too pernickety . Nevertheless , we could all probably"
d06/d06-082/d06-082-04.png,be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle
d06/d06-086/d06-086-00.png,The housewife would find life far less tiring
d06/d06-086/d06-086-01.png,"if she made a list , followed a routine of work"
d06/d06-086/d06-086-02.png,rather than getting from one thing to the next .
d06/d06-086/d06-086-03.png,The business man would find that he reached
d06/d06-086/d06-086-04.png,the end of the day with far less strain if
d06/d06-086/d06-086-05.png,he was a little more systematic . To drift
d06/d06-086/d06-086-06.png,aimlessly along is more wearying than any-
d06/d06-086/d06-086-07.png,thing else . If we would only sit down and
d06/d06-086/d06-086-08.png,write out all the necessary jobs waiting to
d06/d06-086/d06-086-09.png,"be done and then work quietly through them ,"
d06/d06-086/d06-086-10.png,we would find life considerably less exhausting
d06/d06-091/d06-091-00.png,There may be some who will argue that
d06/d06-091/d06-091-01.png,"routine destroys the soul . It is so easy ,"
d06/d06-091/d06-091-02.png,"they say , to get into a rut . Save us"
d06/d06-091/d06-091-03.png,from the school curriculum and even
d06/d06-091/d06-091-04.png,worse the school system whereby for
d06/d06-091/d06-091-05.png,meals everybody knows beforehand
d06/d06-091/d06-091-06.png,"exactly what , on any given day of the"
d06/d06-091/d06-091-07.png,"week , they are going to have . If - such"
d06/d06-091/d06-091-08.png,a critic may say - you are calling
d06/d06-091/d06-091-09.png,"us to adventure , do not strangle us before"
d06/d06-091/d06-091-10.png,we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
d06/d06-096/d06-096-00.png,I am more than conscious of this . How anybody
d06/d06-096/d06-096-01.png,can go through the same routine day in and day
d06/d06-096/d06-096-02.png,out for forty years I find difficult to understand .

d06/d06-100/d06-100-04.png,for this . I know how much of a drag it can be
d06/d06-100/d06-100-05.png,and I was interested some little while
d06/d06-100/d06-100-06.png,ago to hear of a school who tried a six-

d06/d06-104/d06-104-01.png,day week so that in the first week

d06/d06-104/d06-104-04.png,Monday was day six and Tuesday
d06/d06-104/d06-104-05.png,started day one again and so on .
d06/d06-104/d06-104-06.png,By this means they avoided each
d06/d06-104/d06-104-07.png,week being the same with a pupil

d06/d06-107/d06-107-04.png,it added immensely to the interest
d06/d06-107/d06-107-05.png,and kept everybody on their toes .
d06/d06-107/d06-107-06.png,To have order does not mean getting

d07/d07-082/d07-082-04.png,not quoted here because they are not
d07/d07-082/d07-082-05.png,necessary to prove the point made by

d07/d07-085/d07-085-01.png,we have a good illustration of how a
d07/d07-085/d07-085-02.png,sugya has been fashioned from material
d07/d07-085/d07-085-03.png,already in the hands of the Redactors .
d07/d07-085/d07-085-04.png,The sugya is built around the saying of
d07/d07-085/d07-085-05.png,R. Joshua b. Levi . The proof text for the
d07/d07-085/d07-085-06.png,reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
d07/d07-085/d07-085-07.png,with the comment given by Samuel .

d07/d07-089/d07-089-05.png,the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah .
d07/d07-089/d07-089-06.png,There is no reference to the Mishnah here
d07/d07-089/d07-089-07.png,because the Mishnah deals with the
d07/d07-089/d07-089-08.png,actual practice of greeting by the divine
d07/d07-089/d07-089-09.png,Name and the Gemara here quotes the
d07/d07-089/d07-089-10.png,texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi .
d07/d07-093/d07-093-00.png,The question and answer with regard to the
d07/d07-093/d07-093-01.png,need for the text of the angel are quoted
d07/d07-093/d07-093-02.png,here in the same words in which they are
d07/d07-093/d07-093-03.png,quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
d07/d07-093/d07-093-04.png,This can either mean that both sugyas are
d07/d07-093/d07-093-05.png,quoting a well-known question and
d07/d07-093/d07-093-06.png,answer or that our sugya is quoting from
d07/d07-093/d07-093-07.png,the longer sugya which deals with all
d07/d07-093/d07-093-08.png,four texts quoted in the Mishnah .
d07/d07-096/d07-096-00.png,Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
d07/d07-096/d07-096-01.png,original question and answer and this is quoted
d07/d07-096/d07-096-02.png,in the other sugya . ( This can be supported by the
d07/d07-096/d07-096-03.png,use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own
d07/d07-096/d07-096-04.png,accord but there was no approval of his action

d07/d07-096/d07-096-06.png,expression appears to have been framed in
d07/d07-096/d07-096-07.png,"response to the particular point at issue here ,"
d07/d07-096/d07-096-08.png,whether the Heavenly Court concurred

d07/d07-100/d07-100-03.png,"is added , not because this is at all relevant"
d07/d07-100/d07-100-04.png,to the discussion but because it was
d07/d07-100/d07-100-05.png,a familiar interpretation which had
d07/d07-100/d07-100-06.png,become so well known that it was
d07/d07-100/d07-100-07.png,invariably quoted whenever the verse
d07/d07-100/d07-100-08.png,"itself was quoted , almost as if it were a"
d07/d07-102/d07-102-00.png,The Gemara continues with a saying of the

d07/d07-102/d07-102-02.png,' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places :
d07/d07-102/d07-102-03.png,"the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah ,"
d07/d07-102/d07-102-04.png,and the court of Solomon . ' The place of this
d07/d07-102/d07-102-05.png,"saying here is obvious , it follows naturally"
d07/d07-102/d07-102-06.png,on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
d07/d07-102/d07-102-07.png,deals with a similar theme .
e01/e01-014/e01-014-00.png,We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
e01/e01-014/e01-014-01.png,that he was a great man for lace - paying
e01/e01-014/e01-014-02.png,as much as 3 for a lace collar . But this
e01/e01-014/e01-014-03.png,didn't mean he was prepared to do as much
e01/e01-014/e01-014-04.png,"for his lady , for he records testily : ' My wife"
e01/e01-014/e01-014-05.png,and I fell out about my not being willing
e01/e01-014/e01-014-06.png,to have her gown laced . '
e01/e01-018/e01-018-00.png,"We read , with sympathy , an advertisement in the"
e01/e01-018/e01-018-01.png,reign of Charles 2 stating : ' Lost : a lawn 1hand-

e01/e01-018/e01-018-03.png,fine Point lace about four fingers broad ' and
e01/e01-018/e01-018-04.png,among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
e01/e01-018/e01-018-05.png,unpaid bill for ' scarlet satin shoes with
e01/e01-018/e01-018-06.png,silver lace ' . The records of these tender trifles
e01/e01-018/e01-018-07.png,are very touching but then lace does place
e01/e01-018/e01-018-08.png,upon everything a delicate sentiment .
e01/e01-055/e01-055-00.png,One can remember with horror the pictures of the
e01/e01-055/e01-055-01.png,overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
e01/e01-055/e01-055-02.png,"complete with heavy crochet antimacassars , mantel-"
e01/e01-055/e01-055-03.png,piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
e01/e01-055/e01-055-04.png,numerous other crocheted pieces . It was some years
e01/e01-055/e01-055-05.png,after the Victorian period that designers realised
e01/e01-055/e01-055-06.png,"the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was"
e01/e01-055/e01-055-07.png,revived with designs suitable for contemporary
e01/e01-055/e01-055-08.png,"trends . Crochet today has a variety of uses , and"
e01/e01-055/e01-055-09.png,has even stepped into the field of high fashion .
e06/e06-000/e06-000-00.png,This could hardly happen without the
e06/e06-000/e06-000-01.png,herring having some orientation with the
e06/e06-000/e06-000-02.png,sea bottom . It means that the crowding
e06/e06-000/e06-000-03.png,"is caused during the daytime , and that"
e06/e06-000/e06-000-04.png,the herring must continue to migrate over
e06/e06-000/e06-000-05.png,the ground as well as in midwater and
e06/e06-000/e06-000-06.png,during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
e06/e06-000/e06-000-07.png,is always from the north ) .
e06/e06-003/e06-003-00.png,Thus we can see that herring
e06/e06-003/e06-003-01.png,"movements , although primarily"
e06/e06-003/e06-003-02.png,"instinctive perhaps , and certainly"
e06/e06-003/e06-003-03.png,"helped and hindered by water flow ,"
e06/e06-003/e06-003-04.png,are also closely related to the sea-bed
e06/e06-003/e06-003-05.png,"geography . Geography , too , names the"
e06/e06-003/e06-003-06.png,great fisheries that depend on them :
e06/e06-003/e06-003-07.png,the Fladen Ground ( where again most big
e06/e06-003/e06-003-08.png,"shots are taken on the edges ) , the Gut ,"
e06/e06-003/e06-003-09.png,a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
e06/e06-003/e06-003-10.png,the herring spawn along the northern
e06/e06-006/e06-006-00.png,The effect of bottom congestion due to
e06/e06-006/e06-006-01.png,the light pressure is inevitably mixed
e06/e06-006/e06-006-02.png,with that of the suitability of ground
e06/e06-006/e06-006-03.png,"for spawning . Both result in crowding ,"
e06/e06-006/e06-006-04.png,so there is no need to try to separate
e06/e06-006/e06-006-05.png,them - thank Heaven ! A good picture of
e06/e06-006/e06-006-06.png,this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
e06/e06-006/e06-006-07.png,grounds from the Viking in the north down
e06/e06-006/e06-006-08.png,to the Klondykes and the Reef along
e06/e06-006/e06-006-09.png,the western edge of the Norwegian
e06/e06-010/e06-010-00.png,In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
e06/e06-010/e06-010-01.png,Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure . But
e06/e06-010/e06-010-02.png,"they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until"
e06/e06-010/e06-010-03.png,in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
e06/e06-010/e06-010-04.png,echo-sounders . Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
e06/e06-010/e06-010-05.png,their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable
e06/e06-010/e06-010-06.png,gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
e06/e06-010/e06-010-07.png,spawning herring are always found .
e06/e06-015/e06-015-00.png,The joint evidence of echo-sounders
e06/e06-015/e06-015-01.png,and fishing gear leads to an overall
e06/e06-015/e06-015-02.png,though somewhat dim picture .
e06/e06-015/e06-015-03.png,The details are harder still to see .
e06/e06-015/e06-015-04.png,"Drift Effects . At East Anglia , for instance ,"
e06/e06-015/e06-015-05.png,shoals that gather at the Knoll or
e06/e06-015/e06-015-06.png,other banks are most of them
e06/e06-015/e06-015-07.png,going to travel a hundred
e06/e06-015/e06-015-08.png,miles farther south before they
e06/e06-015/e06-015-09.png,spawn . Some will spawn at the
e06/e06-021/e06-021-00.png,So the arrival of any particular shoal
e06/e06-021/e06-021-01.png,fish at a certain spawning ground may
e06/e06-021/e06-021-02.png,be accidental . Yet there will always be some
e06/e06-021/e06-021-03.png,"that find it if enough are travelling , just as"
e06/e06-021/e06-021-04.png,the robin who gets back exactly may be
e06/e06-021/e06-021-05.png,only one among thousands who do not .
e06/e06-021/e06-021-06.png,But this southerly migration is not
e06/e06-021/e06-021-07.png,accidental . Being contranatant or against
e06/e06-021/e06-021-08.png,"the drift , it probably has a survival value"
e06/e06-021/e06-021-09.png,in ensuring that the fry after hatching
e06/e06-021/e06-021-10.png,are drifted back into the normal home
e06/e06-026/e06-026-00.png,Drift in another form probably
e06/e06-026/e06-026-01.png,explains how these migrating herring
e06/e06-026/e06-026-02.png,are biased to east or west by the
e06/e06-026/e06-026-03.png,different winds . Strong westerlies
e06/e06-026/e06-026-04.png,are well known to bring good
e06/e06-026/e06-026-05.png,longshore fishings . The surface
e06/e06-026/e06-026-06.png,water that is blown offshore must
e06/e06-026/e06-026-07.png,be replaced by an underflow bringing
e06/e06-026/e06-026-08.png,with it the herring to the Norfolk
e06/e06-026/e06-026-09.png,and Suffolk beaches .
e06/e06-030/e06-030-00.png,"Easterly winds , on the other hand ,"
e06/e06-030/e06-030-01.png,"mean no herring along the shore , as"
e06/e06-030/e06-030-02.png,recent years have shown . A succession
e06/e06-030/e06-030-03.png,of winds is needed for this effect of
e06/e06-030/e06-030-04.png,"course - one breeze will not do it ,"
e06/e06-030/e06-030-05.png,though a very hard westerly will
e06/e06-030/e06-030-06.png,"often start off the "" local "" herring ;"
e06/e06-030/e06-030-07.png,but quite apart from this wind effect
e06/e06-030/e06-030-08.png,there is an easterly drift special
e06/e06-030/e06-030-09.png,"to this rump of coastline , caused by"
e06/e06-030/e06-030-10.png,the meeting of water from north and south .
e06/e06-033/e06-033-00.png,"Herring fishermen call this "" the outset "" . It"
e06/e06-033/e06-033-01.png,"is strongest at spring tides , when without"

e06/e06-033/e06-033-06.png,"works , it may well be that this outset , akin"
e06/e06-033/e06-033-07.png,"to the mouth of a great salmon river , has"
e06/e06-033/e06-033-08.png,been the biggest factor through the ages

e06/e06-037/e06-037-01.png,has always differed from that of the
e06/e06-037/e06-037-02.png,"summer fisheries . There is the "" swim """
e06/e06-037/e06-037-03.png,"at slack waters , even in daylight"
e06/e06-037/e06-037-04.png,"sometimes ; and the high swimming ,"
e06/e06-037/e06-037-05.png,when fish are caught only in the top
e06/e06-037/e06-037-06.png,few yards of netting . These and other
e06/e06-037/e06-037-07.png,fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
e06/e06-037/e06-037-08.png,"to this fishery , which unfortunately seems"
e06/e06-037/e06-037-09.png,to be dying out ; but a full discussion of
e06/e06-037/e06-037-10.png,them is beyond the present scope .
e06/e06-041/e06-041-00.png,The Bow-wave Theory . This assumes
e06/e06-041/e06-041-01.png,"that all fishing gear , when moving ,"
e06/e06-041/e06-041-02.png,"sends before it a kind of scaring effect ,"
e06/e06-041/e06-041-03.png,probably through waves or vibrations in
e06/e06-041/e06-041-04.png,the water or along the ground .
e06/e06-041/e06-041-05.png,Underwater films suggest that the
e06/e06-041/e06-041-06.png,footrope of a trawl does this . Films
e06/e06-041/e06-041-07.png,have also shown plaice moving before
e06/e06-041/e06-041-08.png,a seine net in just the same way after
e06/e06-041/e06-041-09.png,being gathered inwards by the ropes .
e06/e06-046/e06-046-00.png,( Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved ; it may
e06/e06-046/e06-046-01.png,"be by actual contact , or by sight reaction to the disturbed"
e06/e06-046/e06-046-02.png,"sand ; or even in the case of flat fish , by vibrations"
e06/e06-046/e06-046-03.png,through or along the bottom . ) But given such a bow
e06/e06-046/e06-046-04.png,"wave of disturbance , it is obvious that without something"
e06/e06-046/e06-046-05.png,"to overcome its effect , very few fish would be caught ."
e06/e06-049/e06-049-00.png,Let us consider first what would
e06/e06-049/e06-049-01.png,appear to be the simplest case -
e06/e06-049/e06-049-02.png,that of flat fish on the bottom .
e06/e06-049/e06-049-03.png,The evidence suggest that the fish are
e06/e06-049/e06-049-04.png,aware of the moving footrope before
e06/e06-049/e06-049-05.png,it reaches them . They move away before
e06/e06-049/e06-049-06.png,"it , swimming at the same speed"
e06/e06-049/e06-049-07.png,"for an unknown period of time , until"
e06/e06-049/e06-049-08.png,"they become ( 1 ) tired , or ( 2 ) more used"
e06/e06-049/e06-049-09.png,to the disturbance .
e06/e06-053/e06-053-00.png,Then they stop swimming and are caught . In
e06/e06-053/e06-053-01.png,the seine-net film this usually seemed to
e06/e06-053/e06-053-02.png,happen just after the fish had risen above
e06/e06-053/e06-053-03.png,"the footrope , and presumably out of its"
e06/e06-053/e06-053-04.png,"field of disturbance , or bow wave . This suggests"
e06/e06-053/e06-053-05.png,that the wave might be transmitted by the
e06/e06-053/e06-053-06.png,"sea-bed , though the footrope in this case"
e06/e06-053/e06-053-07.png,was actually just off the bottom and was
e06/e06-053/e06-053-08.png,indeed passing over some fish .
e06/e06-070/e06-070-00.png,Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
e06/e06-070/e06-070-01.png,And in this film the rise of the fish was
e06/e06-070/e06-070-02.png,"small , a matter of a foot or two . With round"
e06/e06-070/e06-070-03.png,"fish like haddock , which would hardly"
e06/e06-070/e06-070-04.png,"find safety on the bottom , this cover"
e06/e06-070/e06-070-05.png,would seem to be even more essential ;
e06/e06-070/e06-070-06.png,but more films are needed to prove this .
e06/e06-070/e06-070-07.png,Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
e06/e06-070/e06-070-08.png,essential to catch round fish whose
e06/e06-070/e06-070-09.png,reaction to disturbance would be upwards .
f04/f04-093/f04-093-00.png,At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector
f04/f04-093/f04-093-01.png,was able to identify a photograph of the
f04/f04-093/f04-093-02.png,"girl , and he said he had last seen her"
f04/f04-093/f04-093-03.png,on platform six waiting to board
f04/f04-093/f04-093-04.png,a train for the short run to Victoria .
f04/f04-093/f04-093-05.png,A passenger at Victoria said he had seen
f04/f04-093/f04-093-06.png,"a young lady "" as near as possible """
f04/f04-093/f04-093-07.png,"like the photograph shown him , with"
f04/f04-093/f04-093-08.png,"a man "" very close in conversation and"
f04/f04-093/f04-093-09.png,"walking arm in arm . """
f04/f04-096/f04-096-00.png,A guard reported that at East Croydon
f04/f04-096/f04-096-01.png,he had seen what was accepted as the
f04/f04-096/f04-096-02.png,same couple sitting close together in
f04/f04-096/f04-096-03.png,a first-class compartment of the
f04/f04-096/f04-096-04.png,train from London Bridge of which
f04/f04-096/f04-096-05.png,he was in charge . The two could
f04/f04-096/f04-096-06.png,have joined this train by taking
f04/f04-096/f04-096-07.png,one from Victoria and changing
f04/f04-096/f04-096-08.png,at East Croydon . He also believed
f04/f04-096/f04-096-09.png,that they had still been together at
f04/f04-096/f04-096-10.png,"South Croydon , and he remembered"
f04/f04-100/f04-100-00.png,Medical evidence established that Mary
f04/f04-100/f04-100-01.png,Money had been dead for about an
f04/f04-100/f04-100-02.png,"hour before her body was discovered ,"
f04/f04-100/f04-100-03.png,and this matched reasonably well with
f04/f04-100/f04-100-04.png,the timetable of the train in question .
f04/f04-100/f04-100-05.png,More important evidence came from a
f04/f04-100/f04-100-06.png,"signalman at Purley Oaks , who had"
f04/f04-100/f04-100-07.png,"seen , as the train passed his box , a"
f04/f04-100/f04-100-08.png,couple struggling in a first-class
f04/f04-100/f04-100-09.png,compartment ; but he seemed to have
f04/f04-100/f04-100-10.png,been used to seeing couples engaged in
