t1.png,Text recognition is a long standing research problem.
t2.png,Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the electronic
t3.png,TrOCR is built up with the Transformer architecture.
t4.png,When loading the above models to the decoders
t5.png,The structures do not precisely match
t6.png,We use the text-recognition task for pre-training
t7.png,Except for the exerpiments regarding scene text recognition
t8.png,Six kinds of image transformations plus keeping the original.
t9.png,To build a large-scale high-quality dataset.
t10.png,We sample two million documents.
t11.png,We use 5247 handwritten texts to synthesize handwriting.
t12.png,Table 1 shows the results of combined models.
t13.png,From the results we observe that the BEiT encoders show
t14.png,For text recognition the most popular approaches.
t15.png,Apple has finally pulled its expensive car dreams
t16.png,The timing is good as its other ambitious reguire alot
t17.png,The Wall Street Journal reports
t18.png,Neither are terribly surprising moves
t19.png,The car effort has been underway for at least a decade
t20.png,with various starts ad stops but made little sense
t21.png,and powerful reasons to avoid lower margin business
t22.png,Generative AI meanwhile is the hottest thing in tech
t23.png,It is now the prime focus of Apple's big-tech competitors
t24.png,has turned chip maker Nvidia into third
t25.png,most valuable U.S. company -- behind Apple and Microsoft
t26.png,And Apple's perceived lagging in the AI race has
t27.png,Microsoft's shares have jumped 10%
t28.png,Making the company that once actually made the Windows phone
t29.png,about $280 billion more valuable than the company
t30.png,But even a cheaper Apple has no shortage of
t31.png,Meta Platforms spent on average on capex over
t32.png,the same period according to S&P Global Market Intelligence
t33.png,A smarter Siri might actually be worth buying
t34.png,California is living up to its reputation
t35.png,as the entertainment capitol of the world
t36.png,witness the political circus unfolding in Sacremento
t37.png,Democrats last autumn enacted a bill that raised the
t38.png,state minimum wage for fast-food workers to $20 an hour
t39.png,But what do you know
t40.png,The legislation carve out an odd exemption
t41.png,for restaurants that produce and sellbread
t42.png,which appears to cover only Panera and a couple of
t43.png,Bloomberg New reported this week that Mr. Newson
t44.png,According to our sources the Service Employees
t45.png,Exuberance is back in markets
t46.png,A frenzy over artifical-intelligence technology
t47.png,has stoked a monster run  in Nvidia technology
t48.png,Major stock indexes are clinching repeated records
t49.png,And even bitcoin is threatening to set a new high
t50.png,In times like these financial advisors caution clients
t51.png,not to let a fear of missing out drive decision-making
t52.png,They encourage them to diversify their holdings
t53.png,Nevertheless stock-market records ofteh happen in clusters
t54.png,with euphoria running high we talked to four everyday
t55.png,Sitting in cash is tempting but could be costly
t56.png,Among his recent stock purchases were Arbor Reality Trust
t57.png,The real estate lender's shares fell 15% this year
t58.png,But don't be afraid to have fun
t59.png,This year he has realloacted about one-third
t60.png,He bought shares of the small-cap focused iShares
t61.png,They're kind of like lottery tickets
t62.png,Deep generative models have achieved tremendos results
t63.png,in designing novel drug molecules in recent years
t64.png,A new thread of work has shown great potential
t65.png,in advancing the speficificty and success rate
t66.png,of in silico drug design by considering
t67.png,the structure of protein pockets
t68.png,This setting posts fundamental computational challenges
t69.png,in sampling new chemical compounds
t70.png,that could satisfy multiple geometric constraints
t71.png,Previous sampling algorithms sample in graph space
t72.png,or only consider the 3D coordinates
t73.png,of atoms while ignoring other detailed chemical
t74.png,structures such as bond tuypes and functional groups
t75.png,To address the challenge we develop
t76.png,an equivariant generative network composed of
t77.png,Medicine have been found to be active in cellular
t78.png,The main intuition of these generative models
t79.png,is to efficiently represent all collected chemical
t80.png,structures in a compact low dimensional space
t81.png,and sample new drug candidates by perturbing
t82.png,However at molecular level a small
t83.png,molecule inhibits or activates particular
t84.png,biological functions only by binding
t85.png,to a specific protein pocket of
t86.png,It can be expected that drug design ignoring
t87.png,the target protein pockets could
t88.png,significantly reduce success rate of downstream
t89.png,In this modified version of the code
t90.png,before adding bonds to the molecule
t91.png,we create a set to store unique
t92.png,We convert each bond tuple to a sorted
t93.png,to ensure uniqueness regardless of order of atoms
t94.png,This prevents dupplicate bonds from being added
t95.png,Finally we iterave over unique bonds
t96.png,and add them to the molecule
t97.png,I can't access external links or specific files
t98.png,including the one you provided
t99.png,However if you could provede the key points
t100.png,or the main findings of the paper
t101.png,The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
t102.png,Appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak
t103.png,The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting
t104.png,If you know the enemy and know yoursef
t105.png,you need not fear the result of a hundred battles
t106.png,If you know yourself but not the enemy
t107.png,for every victory gaind you will also suffer a defeat
t108.png,If you know neither the enemy nor yourself
t109.png,you will succumb in every battle
t110.png,Let your plans be dark and impenetrable at night
t111.png,and when you move fall like a thunderbolt
t112.png,In the midst of chaos there is also opportunity
t113.png,Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance
t114.png,All warfare is based on deception
t115.png,Hence when we are able to attak
t116.png,we must seem unable
t117.png,when using our forces we must appear inactive
t118.png,when we are near we must make the enemy
t119.png,believe we are far away
t120.png,when far away we must make him
t121.png,beleive we are near
